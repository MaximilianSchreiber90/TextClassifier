      "Two weeks after his company attempted to impose a policy targeted at curbing hate content and hateful conduct, Spotify s CEO admitted the company mishandled its roll out. During an interview at this week s Code Conference, Daniel Ek told the crowd, The whole goal with this was to make sure that we didn t have hate speech on the service. It was never about punishing one individual artist, or even naming one individual artist as well. The policy, introduced on May 10, pulled certain artists from Spotify s curated content streams over bad conduct in their personal lives. Pushback on the policy was almost instantaneous, and reports surfaced last week that Spotify was rethinking its approach. In particular, rapper XXXTencion, who was one of two artists single out by the service (along with R. Kelly), was reportedly going to be added back to Spotify s popular Rap Caviar playlist at some unspecified point. Ek acknowledged that the implementation could have been handled better, and that Spotify s intention was never to play the role of moral police. The executive added that the policy is continuing to evolve, with Spotify soliciting user feedback. Among the many thorny issues the company is navigating here is how to address those artists who have been accused — but not actually charged or convicted — of a given crime.\n",

      "A glitch on Overstock s website allowed users to send amounts of Bitcoin Cash to Overstock when the system was expecting Bitcoin, leading to drastic discounts on many items. Given that BTC is about $14,000 and Bitcoin Cash is $2,400, the mistake could have been quite costly. Originally reported by Brian Krebs, the exploit allowed you to send the required amount of BTC in Bitcoin Cash. Then, when you asked for a refund, the system would refund you in Bitcoin. This meant you could send, say, .048 ($135.91) in Bitcoin Cash on a .048 ($700) Bitcoin item, cancel the order, and receive .045 BTC back. Wrote Krebs: Logging into Coinbase, I took the bitcoin address and pasted that into the pay to: field, and then told Coinbase to send 0.00475574 in bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin. The site responded that the payment was complete. Within a few seconds I received an email from Overstock congratulating me on my purchase and stating that the items would be shipped shortly. I had just made a $78 purchase by sending approximately USD $12 worth of bitcoin cash. Crypto-currency alchemy at last! Krebs noted that this scam could have netted quite a profit. If a user had paid the BTC equivalent of a $100,000 diamond ring in Bitcoin Cash they could have sent over $15,000 and, after a refund, gotten $100,000 of Bitcoin. It s a funny and scary glitch that Coinbase has since fixed. Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch\n",

      "Coffee Meets Bagel scored a $12 million Series B this week. The round, led by U.K. VC firm Atami Capital, brings the popular dating app s total up to just under $20 million since launching back in 2012. The San Francisco-based dating app has worked to distinguish itself from competitors like Bumble and Tinder by limiting the number of matches it offers during a 24-hour window. Late last year, it expanded its offering with a video feature, to add an extra dimension to profiles. This month, it introduced additional CMB Experiences to bring users together in the real world. Of course, Coffee Meets Bagel is battling a juggernaut in the form of the billion-dollar Match Group, which currently owns OkCupid, Tinder, PlentyofFish and Match, among others. According to the company, this latest round will drive investments into more CMB Experiences along with international expansion for the service, along with other “product innovation.” Co-CEO Arum Kang also notes that the Series B brings a number of VC firms with prominent female investors, including Gingerbread Capital. We re excited for the next phase of Coffee Meets Bagel, and are pleased to have some wonderful international and female investors on board, Kang says in a release tied to the news. Given our focus on female experience, it was very important that we have a female perspective at the investor level.\n",

      "The 2018 Winter Olympics officially kick off with Friday s Opening Ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The temptation to fly a shiny new drone over the action will no doubt be great for amateur filmmakers and photographers in the immediate area, but DJI s working to put the kibosh on things by implementing a temporary no-fly zone around sports arenas in the country. The flight restrictions will arrive as a part of an update to drone software, instituting restrictions or the duration of the games this month in the South Korean cities of Pyeongchang, Gangneung, Bongpyeong and Jeongseon. The size of the zone is determined by recommendations from aviation authorities. The reasons for the restrictions are pretty clear avoiding collision and other disruptions caused by flying too close to the action. Safety is DJI s top priority and we ve always taken proactive steps to educate our customers to operate within the law and where appropriate, implement temporary no-fly zones during major events, the company said in a statement. We believe this feature will reduce the potential for drone operations that could inadvertently create safety or security concerns. This has become pretty standard practice for the company around various big events in recent years. In the past, DJI has implemented temporary restrictions around the Euro 2016 soccer tournament in France, both major party conventions ahead of the 2016 presidential election and the G7 Summit in Japan.\n",

      "January is less than two days old and already we have a reminder of the bad side of YouTube after it emerged that Logan Paul, a brash 22-year-old with over 15 million subscribers and a clothing line in his name, posted then removed a video that included footage of an apparent suicide victim. The video was taken at Aokigahara, a forest in Japan that is known for suicides. Titled We found a dead body in the Japanese Suicide Forest with a thumbnail image of Paul standing in front of a blurred out body, the video got more than one million views before being removed within 24 hours. In the video, Paul, a number of other YouTubers and a guide who accompanied them found the body of a man who had apparently hung himself. Paul zoomed his video camera to show the body and later took close-up footage with only the face blurred out while the guide phoned the police. The YouTuber who stars in MGM s Valley Girl film which is due out this year and is part of YouTube s paid-for Red subscription service said in the video that he originally intended to focus on the haunted aspect of the forrest. When one of his group said he didn t feel good after seeing the hanging body, Paul said You never stand next to a dead guy? and laughed. More than one million people saw the video before it was pulled. Paul responded to anger at the posting with an apology in which he claimed he was trying to raise awareness of suicide and suicide prevention. In his apology, Paul claimed he has posted videos for more than 15 months which got him caught up in the moment without fully weighing up the possible ramifications. This wasn t a live blog and, as many pointed out on Twitter, Paul and his team had ample time during editing or preparation to elect not post the video. Dear @LoganPaul, How dare you! You disgust me. I can't believe that so many young people look up to you. So sad. Hopefully this latest video woke them up. You are pure trash. Plain and simple. Suicide is not a joke. Go rot in hell. Ap Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) January 2, 2018 Dear @LoganPaul, When my brother found my sister s body, he screamed with horror & confusion & grief & tried to save her. That body was a person someone loved. You do not walk into a suicide forest with a camera and claim mental health awareness. Anna Akana (@AnnaAkana) January 2, 2018 There are no official figures for suicides in Aokigahara, primarily because the Japanese government doesn t want to promote the forest as a suicide destination, but more than 500 people are said to have died there since the 1950s. Japan s suicide rate is the sixth highest in the world although figures have declined in recent years. The latest government report found that 21,897 people took their own life in 2016 while that represented the lowest number for 22 years, suicide remains the top cause of death for people aged 15-39. Disney cut ties with Paul s younger brother, Jake, last year. The younger Paul had been in the media for causing havoc in the West Hollywood neighborhood he moved into. The duo are not the only big name stars from Google-owned YouTube who ran into trouble. PewDiePie lost a contract with Disney following anti-Semitic content on his channel, while he apologized in September for using the n-word in a broadcast. Last year saw YouTube continue to cement its position as the internet s go-to video portal, but a number of troubling incidents demonstrated the issues with unregulated content from new media creators and now bots that create content aimed to gaining clicks from children. In response, YouTube down on unsuitable content removing channels deemed exploitative such as ToyFreaks while it introduced new moderation processes for kid-focused content, and pledged to increase its army of content checkers and moderators to 10,000 people.

But, for most enthusiasts, this confirmation alone is hugely exciting news. The checkered flag has been raised and the finish line is near.

Yesterday, Nintendo revealed that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold more than 7.3 million copies for Switch since its release last April. That means it is on around half of 14.8 million Switch units that Nintendo has sold to date. Nintendo announced its move to finally develop smartphone games in 2015. To date, it has released Super Mario Run, Fire Emblem Heroes and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. Miitomo, the social app that was its first release on mobile, didn t hold its popular and will close down in May.

      "BloomThat, an on-demand flower startup, has sold itself to flower giant FTD, Axios reports. FTD, which offers same-day delivery flowers for a variety of occasions, reportedly paid a small amount of money for the startup. Prior to this reported acquisition, BloomThat had raised $7.5 million from investors like Rothenberg Ventures, Forerunner Ventures, Sherpa Capital and others, with the most recent round in April 2015. In February 2016, BloomThat launched its flower delivery service nationwide. But instead of offering delivery within a couple of hours, BloomThat guaranteed next-day delivery, which effectively moved the startup into the territory of 1-800-FLOWERS and FTD. Unlike many other on-demand companies, BloomThat relies on three key services for its deliveries: FedEx, UPS and Deliv. Before tapping FedEx, UPS and Deliv to handle the actual deliveries, BloomThat managed their own deliveries and owned the logistics from end to end, BloomThat co-founder Matt Schwab told me a couple of years ago. By changing the logistics around delivery and implementing delivery fees, BloomThat s burn rate dropped from $560,000 to $15,000 a month. I ve reached out to both BloomThat and FTD.

      "Because there are not enough ways to get around major cities and campuses, Spin is working to launch stationless electric scooter-sharing. These aren t the electric scooters you see in San Francisco, operated by Scoot Networks. These are essentially electrified Razor-like scooters that can go up to 15 mph and cover 18 miles on a single charge. Spin s mission is to transform cities and campuses with smart mobility solutions, Spin co- founder and President Euwyn Poon said in a statement. We believe in multiple modes of last-mile transportation and the electric scooter is a fast, fun option for short distances. The introduction of the electric scooter marks the transition of Spin into a true multi-modal mobility platform for cities and campuses. In order to deter theft, Spin s scooters require riders to unlock the wheels with the app. There is also a built-in GPS on each scooter. Last August, Spin brought its stationless bike-share program to South San Francisco after launching in Seattle earlier that year. Then, just last month, Spin unveiled its stationless electric bike. Although the company is based in San Francisco, it s going to be a little while until it can launch its stationless bike-share in the city. That s because the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency granted an exclusive 18-month pilot to JUMP for stationless bike-sharing. It s not clear if the SFMTA s permit with JUMP prevents other companies from launching other types of stationless transportation sharing services. I ve reached out to the SFTMA and will update this when I hear back. During a demo of the scooter, Poon told me the company is in early talks with the SFMTA and expects its stationless bikes to receive a permit soon. Unlike Spin s bikes, which you can rent for $1 for 30 minutes, the scooters will be a bit more expensive to rent, costing $1 to unlock and then 15 cents per minute. Spin s plan is to first launch these scooters in some of its existing markets, which include Seattle, Washington D.C. and Dallas. Featured Image: Spin\n",

The one thing we ll all remember when we re all old and gray, telling our grandchildren the war stories from our years in the tech blogging trenches, are all of the non-tech news madness at the event.

The Consumer Tech Association, which puts on the show, address the occurrence on social media, stating, There is an isolated power outage at the Las Vegas Convention Center. We are working hard to resolve this and appreciate your patience. Thankfully, this is CES, so there are plenty of folks on-hand to document the Central Hall evacuation and the bizarre scene inside. . #CESBLACKOUT all halls at Las Vegas Convention are without power an event staffer says and people are being asked to evacuate.

Also get outside on this beautiful Las Vegas day and check out Central and South Plaza. The power outage has apparently left some in the hall relatively unscathed. The Tesla booth appears to be making the most out of an unfortunately situation, and this violin player at the Intel booth seems to still be having an okay time. The outage has been on-going for about an hour as of this post. We ve reached out to the CTA for further comment. In the meantime, feel free to point out all of the applicable metaphors to the current state of the electronics industry. Update: Things appear to have gone from bad to worse. The blackout has impacted the convention center s North Hall, as well, leaving only the South Hall fully operational. The CTA is now recommending that people check out all of the exhibitors outside.

      "Xiaomi’s very-iPhone-X-looking Mi 8 smartphone was the highlight of its Shenzhen press event today, but the company did also unveil a number of other notable products, including an updated version of its popular fitness band. The Mi Band has always offered a solid performance at around $30 — to the point that I’ve bought two of them for myself — and the third incarnation pushes things further. Mi Band 3 includes a longer 20 days of battery life per charge, 50-meter water resistance and a new band design that Xiaomi touts as being both more comfortable and more secure on your wrist. Like the Mi Band 2, the third-gen tracker includes a pulse monitor and the usual fitness tracking. It syncs to the Xiaomi Mi Fit app, with data exportation to other services possible. The Mi Band isn’t a full blown fitness band, for example it doesn’t include GPS so it won’t help you track runs on apps like Strava, but at just 69 yuan, or around $25, it is a seriously cheap option. The Mi Band 3 will make its debut in China first, where it’ll come in a choice of red, black and blue. Like most Xiaomi products, we’ll have to wait on details of international availability but it will almost certainly be sold outside of China soon. Aside from the Mi Band 3 and Mi 8, Xiaomi also unveiled its Mi VR Standalone product, which was developed alongside Facebook-owned Oculus, which is now home to former Xiaomi international executive Hugo Barra. Xiaomi also took the wraps off its largest smart TV to date, the 75-inch Mi TV 4.\n",

      "In what amounts to faint praise for the strength of the physical book NPD reported that print book sales rose 1.9 percent in 2017, less than the 3 percent growth posted in 2013-2016. NPD tracks book sales in the US. They write: Returning from the huge sales of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in 2016, and the rise of adult coloring books, last year s book sales growth was more modest than the industry has seen in recent years, said Kristen McLean, books industry analyst for The NPD Group. Big blockbusters are both a blessing and a curse for the book publishing industry. In the years where they hit, they drive tremendous success for publishers; but afterwards the inevitable drop in sales back towards normal feels like a loss. It is a feast or famine phenomenon, if no blockbusters emerge to take their place the following year. What does this mean for readers? First it shows us that physical book sales stall in the absence of any single blockbuster usually a kid s title to buoy the market. Further, children s books are the last refuge of the print publisher. Children s books continued to thrive with a 3 percent boost in 2017, led by R.J. Palacio s Wonder and Jeff Kinney s Diary of a Wimpy Kid #12: The Getaway.' the NPD wrote. There were lifts in early childhood books, with 11 percent year-over-year growth in board books and 20 percent growth in graphic novels, tied to the success of Dav Pilkey s Dog Man series. NPD doesn t supply any numbers nor did it compare print sales to digital but this sort of flat to slow growth doesn t bode well for fans of the printed word.\n",

      "Just days after \"Roseanne\" made a blockbuster return, ABC is set to order a second season, according to a source at the network. The move is a no-brainer. ABC was in need of a new hit show, and \"Roseanne\" is the biggest out-of-the-box hit to come along in years. The announcement of Season 2 is \"imminent,\" the source said Thursday evening. Earlier, Deadline reported that the cast deals for the new season are already in place, meaning Roseanne Barr and the other stars have already signed up for more episodes. The \"Roseanne\" reboot has been the talk of Hollywood ever since initial ratings from Nielsen showed that 18 million people tuned in to it on Tuesday night. Related: 'Roseanne' comes roaring back The ratings home run is a testament to the enduring power of big-tent broadcast television. President Donald Trump wrapped himself in the \"Roseanne\" ratings news. On Thursday, he touted the show's success during a speech in Ohio. \"Look at Roseanne -- look at her ratings,\" he said. \"They were unbelievable. Over 18 million people! And it was about us!\" The president also called Barr -- a longtime friend -- to celebrate. \"This is 100% in Trump's sweet spot,\" New York Times TV critic James Poniewozik tweeted Thursday. He said Trump obsesses over ratings, \"bashes Hollywood but craves its validation,\" and \"divides the world into things that are 'pro TRUMP' and 'against TRUMP.'\" Noting Trump's disinterest in scripted programming, Poniewozik said \"I doubt he will ever watch Roseanne, but in his mind, a 'pro TRUMP' thing won.\" This is 100% in Trump's sweet spot. 1. Obsessed with ratings as metric 2. Bashes Hollywood but craves its validation 3. Divides the world into things that are \"pro TRUMP\" and \"against TRUMP\"; I doubt he will ever watch Roseanne, but in his mind, a \"pro TRUMP\" thing won https://t.co/2SbFJucvcZ — James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) March 29, 2018 The sitcom's red-state appeal is a factor for sure -- but it's not the only one. In fact, there's been some backlash to the idea that the show's launch was Trump-fueled. \"The 'Roseanne' narrative has gotten out of control,\" former Amazon Studios executive Matthew Ball tweeted. He pointed out that the series \"was the biggest show on TV\" in 1990, so \"it is no surprise that with this base plus press attention, audiences turned up. That was the point.\" 3/ It's easy to say Roseanne reaches under-served, middle of the country Trump voters, but does anyone believe that a Seinfeld, Cosby Show (ceteris paribus), Friends, Cheers, Frasier reboot wouldn't score as well if not higher? — Matthew Ball (@ballmatthew) March 30, 2018 An ABC source made a similar point on Thursday, saying, \"The Trump of it all is exaggerated.\" The source described ABC's view of the ratings victory, citing many other reasons why the reboot clicked: \"Wickedly funny. Beloved characters. Emotional.\" The show had a built-in fan base from its previous incarnation on ABC. It benefited from strong writing and producing and a \"huge ABC promotional push,\" the source added. The first two episodes of Season 1 aired on Tuesday. There's not as much Trump talk in the seven remaining episodes, producers and executives told The New York Times on Thursday. But there's lots of social commentary: Unemployment, health care, poverty, opioid abuse and single motherhood are all addressed. Related: It makes perfect sense that Roseanne is a Trump voter ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said \"Roseanne\" was part of a post-election strategy by ABC. Up until election day in 2016, \"we had spent a lot of time looking for diverse voices in terms of people of color and people from different religions and even people with a different perspective on gender,\" Dungey told The Times. \"But we had not been thinking nearly enough about economic diversity and some of the other cultural divisions within our own country. That's been something we've been really looking at with eyes open since that time.\" Like the original \"Roseanne\" in the 1990s, the show portrays a working class family. Barr is both a Trump supporter in real life and on the show. \"People gather round and they see themselves in this family,\" Disney-ABC Television Group president Ben Sherwood told The Times. \"It speaks to a large number of people in the country who don't see themselves on television very often.\" Related: 'Roseanne' reboot is damn good. The star deserves none of the credit Disney CEO Bob Iger tweeted about \"Roseanne\" on Thursday, including the show in a list of other Disney (DIS) brands: \"Black Panther,\" \"Modern Family,\" \"Coco,\" \"Black-ish,\" \"Zootopia,\" \"Moana,\" \"Fresh Off The Boat,\" \"Avengers,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"A Wrinkle In Time.\" Iger said they're \"all reflections of the wide variety of people, backgrounds and opinions of the world we live in.\" Now there's lots of chatter in entertainment industry circles about \"Roseanne\" copycats. CNN commentator and former Republican National Committee communications director Doug Heye said no one should have been surprised by the show's performance. \"Obviously, the 'Roseanne' numbers are absolutely huge, but I think it's only a surprise to, and I kind of hate the term, 'coastal elites,' who don't know, don't get and don't want to get, conservatives,\" he said in an email. \"How many times have we seen a super strong opening for a Christian movie that the Hollywood promotional industrial complex never talked about?\" Expectations will be high and remain so for the rest of the season. The ABC source said there's no downside to having Trump talking about the series. Simply put, it's \"more attention,\" the source said. -- A version of this story first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. Subscribe here!\n",

Right now, that’s mostly hikes and trails; eventually, the Wing It team hopes to expand their knowledge base out to things like kayaking trips, rock climbing, or nearby surf spots. Wing It focuses on things that are far enough away to feel like a vacation, but close enough to do on a whim. While early iterations of the bot tried to offer up trips involving last minute flights, they’ve since learned to focus on things within driving distance. “People would say they’d go on a last minute flight… 98% of people would say ‘I’m in!’. Then you send’em that, and give them the option to book it, and… nothing.” The underlying concept of a trip planning search engine is by no means new, but there’s something nice about the way it all fits together here. Too many weekend trips die in the planning phases that moment when you dive into Airbnb and drown under a million options and decide to do it later. Wing It boils it all down to a handful of choices based on what it already knows you’re looking for. That slimmed down and curated offering is what Wing It’s co-founders, Luis De Pombo and Gabriel Ascanio, are going for. After meeting in school, they started working together on side projects on the weekends. They’d try to mix up the scenery by traveling to new locales on the weekends, only to spend half their time just searching for the right place. So why a Messenger bot? “Because of the ease of reaching people”, Gabriel tells me. There’s no app to download – you just start a conversation with the bot. Meanwhile, the team can iterate on their concept almost instantly. If the data shows users are liking a feature, they can play it up with no need for a downloaded update; if they change something and usage tanks, they can reverse course on the fly. Wing It is part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2018 class, and has yet to raise funds beyond that.\n",

      "Whoever thought we would leave telemarketing behind in this brave new smartphone world of ours lacked imagination. Robocalls are a menace growing in volume and even a massive $120 million fine leveled against a prominent source of them by the FCC likely won’t stem the flood. The fine was announced today during the FCC’s monthly open meeting: a Mr Adrian Abramovich was responsible for nearly 100 million robocalls over a three-month period, and will almost certainly be bankrupted by this record forfteiture. “Our decision sends a loud and clear message,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in a statement. “This FCC is an active cop on the beat and will throw the book at anyone who violates our spoofing and robocall rules and harms consumers.” That sounds impressive until you hear that these calls took place in 2016, and meanwhile there were 3.4 billion robocalls made last month alone. Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel applauds the fine, but questions the practicality of pursuing damages when actions need to be taken to prevent the crimes in the first place. “Let s be honest,” she wrote in a statement, “Going after a single bad actor is emptying the ocean with a teaspoon.” She points out that a set of rules designed to prevent robocalls was overturned a couple months ago, and that 20 petitions to the FCC under those rules for legal exemptions and such have yet to be addressed. And a technology designed to prevent robocalls altogether, recommended in a report more than a year ago and currently set to be implemented in Canada in 2019, has no such date here in the States. As someone who gets these robocalls all the time, I fully support both this fine and the more serious measures Rosenworcel suggests. And the faster the better, I literally got one while writing this story.\n",

      "It seems clear that Niantic always had broader plans than simple casual gaming. The Google-supported startup s 2016 title Pok mon GO is largely considered a major factor in helping to mainstream augmented reality technology. Now the company is looking to take things a step further, tapping its massive user base to help build some large-scale AR maps. The plan was first reported by Reuters this morning, courtesy of a conversation with Niantic CEO John Hanke. The executive told the service, We want players to build out the game board they want to play on, adding that the world building would foster a new kind of social activity. There s no timeline for any of this. And it s not entirely clear whether the mapping will be output from Pok mon or the company s eagerly anticipated followup, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. What is clear, however, is that the company plans to start in public spaces like parks, utilizing AR tech built by recent acquisition, Escher Reality. The plan here is to build a larger platform that can be utilized by third parties. It s a feature that s only likely to grow in demand as major mobile players like Apple and Google push developers to build AR apps through initiatives like ARKit and ARCore. Google, which has supported the company since its earliest days, has been reasserting its commitment to augmented reality this week at Google I/O through offerings like the upcoming walking navigation in Maps.\n",

      "Attic Labs, the creator of Noms, an open-source decentralized database, announced today that is being acquired by Salesforce. Terms of the deal, Salesforce s first acquisition of 2018, were undisclosed. Last year, the company only bought digital creative agency Sequence, according to Crunchbase, taking a break from an acquisition spree in 2016 when it snapped up a dozen companies. Noms was launched in August 2016, at the same time Attic Labs announced it had raised an $8.1 million Series A round led by Greylock. Founders Aaron Boodman and Rafael Weinstein, along with many other members of Attic Labs team, previously worked on Google Chrome. Boodman also created Greasemonkey. Like Git, Noms lets users replicated data and edit it offline on multiple machines, then syncs up the edits. It also emphasizes versioning so edits don t destroy previous versions of data, making it easier to retrieve if necessary. Unlike Git, however, Noms is written to store structured data instead of text files and support very large data sets. In its announcement, Attic Labs said Noms will remain open source. In a Noms forum post, Boodman added that Attic Labs has no immediate plans for additional work on the database. After the acquisition is completed, Attic Labs team will join Quip, the document collaboration platform Salesforce bought in August 2016 for $750 million. Attic Labs said Noms tech will extend Quip s ability to connect live data sources, making it easier for people to collaborate faster and more effectively.

      "Uberall, the Berlin-headquartered startup that has developed a cloud-based platform to let small and large businesses get listed and market themselves across multiple location-based services, has picked up $25 million in Series B funding. Leading the round is HPE Growth Capital, who join existing investors that include Project A, and United Internet. The company says it will use the new capital for product development and international expansion, including a focus on the U.S. where Uberall already has an office in San Francisco. Founded in 2013 by David Federhen, Florian H bner, and Josha Benner, Uberall offers a Software-as-a-Service for SMEs and larger companies (who have multiple stores) to manage their various location marketing across all of the various platforms, from search and directories, to maps and sat-nav. In a call with Uberall co-CEO H bner, he said this includes getting your shop or store listed on all of the supported services via a single submission and control centre. This spans search engines and local directories such as Google, Where To?, Scoot, 192, Opendi, and Hotfrog, and online maps such as Bing, Google Maps, HERE (ex. Nokia) and Apple Maps. Social products that have a location element are also supported, including Facebook, Foursquare, Yelp, and Instagram. As are Navigation services, such as Uber, Waze, and in-car sat navs (mostly powered through HERE), Navmii, and TomTom. To manage all of these individually is a lot of work and prohibitively time consuming, which is the first problem Uberall set out to solve. This also includes helping to inject as much structured data as possible into each of the 100 or so supported services e.g. location, opening times, menu items, facilities etc., which is non-trivial since there isn t a standard format for all data. However, explained H bner, beyond listing a business, the SaaS has since developed to be a full suite of location marketing features that also supports managing engagement in the form of reviews and ratings including, most importantly, responding to customer feedback, which also contributes to how prominently a business is listed. And once you ve got your business properly listed and are able to manage your presence, Uberall has a location-based advertising product, too. This sees placing location-based adds made a lot easier, especially for smaller businesses who don t have a budget to employ a campaign manager or it wouldn t be cost effective in terms of ROI to do so. In other words, come to Uberall for the listings and engagement management and stay for the location-based advertising. The startup charges a per month fee per business location. To date, Uberall says it counts a range of well-known clients from different industries as customers, including Domino s, DHL Group, Vodafone, IHG, Deutsche Telekom, Thyssenkrupp, HUK Coburg, and Douglas. In addition, the SaaS is being used by SMEs, increasingly via the distribution partnerships it has with 1&1 Internet, Swisscom, Sensis, Vendasta, and OVH.\n",

      "If you ve tried selling your old smartphone on a refurbishment website, chances are you ended up with a dozen browser tabs comparing prices. French startup Back Market is taking advantage of this fragmented industry to create a marketplace and aggregate all refurbishers on a single online platform. The startup just raised $48 million ( 41 million). Groupe Arnault, Eurazeo, Agla Ventures and Daphni participated in today s funding round. Back in May, the company told me that it was working with over 270 factories. Back Market has generated over $110 million in gross merchandise volume over the past three years. The service is now live in France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and Italy. The company just expanded to the U.S. Before, refurbishment was just a thing for tech savvy people and tech bloggers, co-founder and chief creative officer Vianney Vaute told me. With Back Market, it becomes a mainstream alternative. Working with multiple factories is also a competitive advantage when it comes to pricing, fail rate and quality assurance. Back Market has an overview on the industry and can choose to work with some partners and leave underperforming ones behind. The startup needs to build a brand that consumers can trust. While smartphones and laptops are the most prominent products on the homepage, Back Market also accepts game consoles, TVs, headphones, coffee machines and more. Back Market also sells Apple products refurbished by Apple itself. Now that smartphones have become a mature market, many customers aren t looking for new and shiny devices. Some customers can be perfectly happy with a phone that was released last year or two years ago. It represents an opportunity for Back Market and the refurbishment industry as a whole.\n",

      "As Uber works on trying to find a more profitable path ahead for its transportation-on-demand service, it has sold off one of its units that sat peripherally to that business. Fair, the car leasing startup that announced debt and equity funding of up to $1 billion in October, has acquired the active leasing portfolio of Xchange Leasing, a service Uber first established in 2015 to lease new and nearly-new vehicles to drivers who did not come to the service with their own cars. The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, Fair s co-founder and CEO Scott Painter told TechCrunch in an interview. In December, there were reports that a deal was in the works between the two after Uber decided to wind down the operation. Those reports claimed Xchange s book value for its fleet of 30,000 cars was around $400 million, a figure that Painter did not dispute. As part of the sale, Fair becomes Uber s exclusive partner for leasing services for its drivers in the U.S. who want to lease cars for 30 days or more. Fair also has a direct-to-consumer business and that will continue alongside the deal, but Fair will not be entering into more partnerships with other transportation-on-demand companies that compete with Uber in the U.S.. Uber is big enough for us for now, Painter said. There were reports that Uber was losing around $9,000 per car on the service putting a strain on the company s attempt to stem its losses and build a more financially sustainable business. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber s new CEO, has set a goal of making the company profitable in the next three years. The outsized transportation startup has now raised $22.2 billion and is now valued at $48 billion, but it s been pumping that funding into very aggressive expansion plans that have included passenger and driver acquisition subsidies, fighting regulatory battles, R&D and other costly efforts. It s not an unrealistic goal much smaller transportation companies have been close to or are already in the black. Now the idea is, as the British like to say, horses for courses. Uber will focus on its transportation service and building better relationships with those in its two-sided marketplace of drivers and passengers, while Fair will take on the leasing operation. As we progress on our mission to deliver better experiences for drivers, Uber is excited to partner with companies like Fair that have deep domain expertise and innovative solutions, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a statement. We look forward to working closely with Fair to develop thoughtful, customized options for drivers in the U.S. On the side of Fair, it will be interesting to see how Fair manages the economics of a business that did not prove to be financially fruitful for Uber. Painter argues that in its favor, Fair is only working on leasing services (for now; there will be purchasing options added over time) and has optimised its platform to fit the economics of this model. It s an emerging area of the transportation industry, and one that automakers might also look to get involved in more directly, bypassing the traditional companies involved in renting vehicles, judging by recent moves from Ford and GM. Car ownership is changing, said Painter, a familiar refrain in the automotive world today. The plan for Fair which is backed by strategic investors that include Penske and BMW is to be one of the companies at the center of how cars will be used by consumers in that future. This isn t a completely left-field idea. Even if the price of autonomous and other next-generation cars comes down over time, there are many in the automotive market who question whether they will ever be as affordable to the mass market as cars are today. Still to come will be what the two plan to do outside the U.S., where Fair has yet to expand but wants to. International markets are definitely in our plans, he said, noting that existing regulations for leasing in places like Europe will make entry relatively painless. This could potentially involve expanding its relationship with Uber, or using international markets to work out partnerships with others in the space, given that Uber is not always the dominant player in every country. From what we understand, Fair has also secured and closed more funding, but Painter declined to talk about that in our interview. However, that funding could, in part, be used for an international push. Fair s existing business model is predicated on the idea of an all-in service, where customers monthly fee for leasing a vehicle also includes maintenance and some roadside assistance, with the option also of purchasing insurance through the platform, both to protect the driver and protect our assets. This is the company s first acquisition, after a deal early in its life fell through to buy the assets of failed car selling and buying app Beepi. It s not clear how many staff from Xchange Leasing will be joining Fair as part of this deal. There were 500 employees working in the unit under Uber, and reports in December alleged that the number going to Fair will be around 150. Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n",

      "Workday, the cloud-based platform that offers HR and other back-office apps for businesses, is making an acquisition to expand its portfolio of services: it’s buying Adaptive Insights, a provider of cloud-based business planning and financial modelling tools, for $1.55 billion. The acquisition is notable because Adaptive Insights had filed for an IPO as recently as May 17. Workday says that the $1.55 billion price tag includes “the assumption of approximately $150 million in unvested equity issued to Adaptive Insights employees” related to that IPO. This deal is expected to close in Q3 of this year. IPO filings are known to sometimes trigger M&A. Most recently, PayPal announced it would acquire iZettle just after the latter filed to go public. Skype was acquired by Microsoft in 2011 while it was waiting to IPO after previous owner eBay said it would spin it off. Workday itself went public in 2012 and currently has a market cap of nearly $27 billion. The deal will give Workday another string to its bow, in its attempt to become the go-to place for all for back-office services for its business customers: the company plans to integrate Adaptive Insights’ tools into its existing platform. Adaptive Insights is an industry leader with its Business Planning Cloud platform, and together with Workday, we will help customers accelerate their finance transformation in the cloud,” said Aneel Bhusri, Co-Founder and CEO, Workday, in a statement. I am excited to welcome the Adaptive Insights team to Workday and look forward to coming together to continue delivering industry-leading products that equip finance organizations to make even faster, better business decisions to adapt to change and to drive growth. The two have been working together as partners since 2015. In the case Adaptive Insights, which says it has ‘thousands’ of customers, its growth mirrors that both of cloud services and specifically about how business intelligence has developed into a distinct software category of its own over the years, with not just the CFO but an army of in-house analysts relying on analytics of a business’ data to help make small and big decisions. The market opportunity here is huge as the CFO has become a power player in the C-Suite, CEO Tom Bogan told TechCrunch when it raised $75 million in 2015, when it first passed the billion-dollar mark for its valuation. Bogan previously also held a role as chairman of Citrix. As a former CFO myself, I have seen this first hand and it is accelerating.” Other examples of this force includes Twitter s Anthony Noto catapulting from CFO to COO (and is now a CEO running SoFi). Around 25 percent of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are former CFOs. Adaptive Insights had raised $175 million prior to this. Bogan will stay on and lead the business and report directly to Bhusri. Joining forces with Workday accelerates our vision to drive holistic business planning and digital transformation for our customers, said Bogan, in a separate statement. Most importantly, both Adaptive Insights and Workday have an employee-first and customer-centric approach to developing enterprise software that will only increase the power of the combined companies. More generally, while we have certainly seen a much wider opening of the door for tech IPOs this year, there is also an argument to be made for continuing consolidation it enterprise IT, in particular with regards to cloud services that might have small or potentially negative margins. Adaptive Insights was not immune to that: the company in its public listing filing said that its previous fiscal year brough tin $106.5 million in revenues, up 30 percent from the year before, but it also posted a loss of $42.7 million in the same period. That was narrower than the $59.1 million it posted in 2016. Combined with the bigger trend of all-in-one platforms packing a bigger punch with businesses, it might have meant that Workday’s offer was too compelling to refuse. This looks like Workday’s biggest acquisition yet, but the company has been on a spree of sorts: just last week it announced the acquisition of RallyTeam to beef up its machine learning.\n",

      "Goodlord, the London proptech startup that has built a software platform to handle transactions and the paperwork normally associated with renting a home, has laid off nearly 40 employees, while TechCrunch understands from sources that co-founder and CEO Richard White will soon be leaving the company. The job losses are said to be in sales and marketing, and come just nine months after Goodlord announced 7.2 million in funding led by Rocket Internet s GFC. LocalGlobe and Ribbit Capital also participated in the Series A round. Regarding White s pending departure, it is not clear if a new CEO has already been lined up. I have also been unable to confirm if Goodlord CTO Andrew Done remains at the startup, although it is possible that he has already departed. I ve asked Goodlord for further details but a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on any changes in leadership, expect to say that White is still the CEO. In a call, co-founder and COO Tom Mundy also declined to comment further. However, I stand by my reporting and expect an official announcement to be issued in due course. On the sales and marketing downsizing, which was first reported by website Property Industry Eye, Goodlord has issued the following statement: We have had great success during 2017 bringing new lettings agents onto the platform, however, to focus on scaling effectively and efficiently we have reduced the size of our sales and marketing team and are putting more focus on bringing out new features and automation functionality to the platform. Our customers will see the effects of this focus almost immediately with new features and services being released as soon as the end of the month. To reflect the increased emphasis on product and technology we restructured the business and following a consultation period we reduced the number of employees from 134 to 96. All affected employees have benefited from an extended paid notice period and have been offered as much support as possible to help them find their next big thing. To ensure we offer the very best platform we can, we have a number of positions open for extremely talented product and engineering staff. We remain focused on building a business with superior technology and outstanding customer service and our letting agent customers will see no change in the levels of service we offer them. Founded in 2014, unlike other startups in the rental market space that want to essentially destroy traditional brick n mortar letting agents with an online equivalent, Goodlord s Software-as-a-Service is designed to support all stakeholders, including traditional high-street letting agents, as well as landlords and, of course, tenants. The Goodlord SaaS enables letting agents to digitize the moving-in process, including utilizing e-signatures and collecting rental payments online. In addition, the company sells landlord insurance, and has been working on other related products, such as rental guarantees, and tenant passports. The latter means that, if Goodlord reaches scale, it wants to let tenants easily take their rental transaction history and landlord references with them when moving from one rental property to another as proof that they are a trustworthy tenant. The idea of offering Generation Rent a portable profile with built in trust is also being potentially pursued by other startups, such as Acasa, which focuses on utilities and other shared household expenditure.\n",

      "RED s Hydrogen One handset is one of those devices we ll believe when we actually see. The company s been promising up the $1,200 smartphone for a while now, only to be hit with delays and outright admit, We have no idea whatsoever what we are doing. Consider this some small vote of confidence, however. AT&T announced today that it will be carrying the 5.7-inch holographic display device. That, of course, shouldn t be taken as a tacit approval of the device, so much as a confirmation of the fact that it does, in fact, exist. Though in a press release tied to the announcement, a market SVP says, This revolutionary smartphone will provide you with significant advancements in the way you create and view content on the leading network for entertainment. So, take that as you will. Personally, I’m holding off any sort of judgement until I can hold the thing in my hands. The carrier mentions later this summer in the press release, which lines up with RED s most recent mention of an August launch date. As for price, your guess is as good as ours. We reached out to AT&T to see whether the company will be subsidizing the product on contract, or simply offering up the $1,200 phone as is through its retail channel. The carrier won t comment on that, yet, though its Next subsidy plan might make sense, cushioning the cost by stretching it out over a longer period. The Hydrogen One is, by all accounts, about as far as you can get from a mainstream piece of mobile hardware. At the moment, it feels more like a fun consumer electronics thought experiment, but at least it s one that s real and coming to the second largest mobile carrier in the U.S. at some point this summer. Update: Looks like Verizon will be getting the phone, as well. The carrier (which, disclosure, owns the company that owns TechCrunch) will be getting the phone in the even broader timeframe of “later this year.” No word on pricing there, either.\n",

      "Sweden’s Instabridge, the Wi-Fi sharing community and mobile app that has proved particularly popular in Brazil and Mexico, has scored $3 million in further funding — money it’s pegged for Asia expansion, starting with India. The new round is led by Luminar Ventures (headed up by Magnus Bergman and Jacob Key), with participation from previous backers Balderton Capital, Draper Associates, Moor, and Creandum. The company had previously raised around $5 million. Originally founded in late 2012 as a way to enable you to share your home Wi-Fi with friends on Facebook, the Stockholm-based company has since pivoted to become a broader Wi-Fi sharing community, and has found traction in developing markets where cellular data remains prohibitively expensive. The Instabridge app lets you share the details of any Wi-Fi hotspot with other Instabridge users, and provides access to Wi-Fi hotspots shared by everyone else in the community. This has enabled it to build a crowdsourced database of Wi-Fi hotspots, in addition to a list of known public venues that have free Wi-Fi, such as McDonald s or Starbucks. Instabridge says it plans to build on the traction it has seen in South America by targeting India’s population of over 1 billion people, of which it says only 400 million currently have internet access. This, Instabridge co-founder Niklas Agevik tells me, will include building out a team in India, and plays into the company’s new-found mission of expanding internet access in developing countries where internet services remain relatively expensive and yet access to the internet is a proven means of “reducing income inequality”. Meanwhile, I’m told that Instabridge is now seeing 2.3 million Monthly Active Users, and is growing at a rate of 50,000 new users per day. The Instabridge database now houses the details of 2 million Wi-Fi spots.\n",

      "Google is back investing in ride-hailing companies. The U.S. search firm and China s Meituan-Dianping are among the tech giants set to invest in Go-Jek, the Indonesia-based rival to Grab and Uber, a source with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. We understand a deal could be completed as soon as next week, though whether Go-Jek announces it is unclear since it has history of not disclosing new investments. Reuters reports that round is worth $1.2 billion, and we re hearing that is accurate but with a caveat. These new investors are part of a follow-on to an investment made last year, according to our source. Funding rounds are often complicated and not as clean as they may appear once announced. In Go-Jek s case, it secured investment from Chinese internet giant Tencent in March last year as an initial tranche of a planned $1.2 billion raise. Existing investors including KKR, Warburg Pincus, Sequoia Capital, Northstar Group, DST Global and NSI Ventures agreed to follow on and Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com joined later in the year, too, but an allocation was left open. Now that is full and the round is complete with commitments from Google, Temasek and Meituan-Dianping. We don t have confirmed numbers for those stakes but, as latecomers to the party, they are likely to be fairly small and strategic in nature. We understand the investment gives Go-Jek a valuation that is a touch above the $3 billion that Tencent agreed to invest at last year. Google declined to comment. Representatives from Go-Jek, Temasek and Meituan-Dianping did not respond to requests for comment. Go-Jek previously raised $550 million in 2016 so this is a big jump, but the competition has also increased its rounds by significant multiples. Singapore-based Grab has raised more than $4 billion to date, including a $2.5 billion round led by SoftBank and China s Didi Chuxing at a $6 billion valuation. Uber remains the world s highest funded private tech startup with over $20 billion from investors, including a recent cut-price valuation deal with SoftBank. Interestingly, our source confirmed that Google itself is investing directly rather than its Google Ventures unit. Just one month ago, Google made its first direct investment in India when it backed concierge app Dunzo. That, combined with the Go-Jek investment, indicates an increased interest in India and Indonesia, two of the world s most promising emerging markets for tech and consumer internet services, beyond the product work it is doing in both regions. It also adds another wrinkle to the complicated relationship of ride-hailing companies worldwide. Google Ventures invested in Uber in 2013 and, after a legal suit caused the relationship to get frosty, it backed Lyft last year. Meituan-Dianping, meanwhile, may not be well known in the west but it is another significant addition. The company was formed through a merger between China s top two local commerce platforms and is valued at $30 billion. Beyond providing a platform that lets physical retail stores tap the internet for business, it is aggressively moving into ride-sharing in China where it hopes to rival Didi thanks to a $4 billion investment that closed last year. A foray into Southeast Asia through Go-Jek makes sense in that context, but Meituan-Dianping may also look to work with Go-Jek to expand its core service known as offline-to-online in Indonesia, which is the world s fourth most populous country with over 250 million people. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said Southeast Asia is unprofitable, but the region which is home to 600 million consumers is tipped to see huge growth. Ride-hailing in the region is predicted to become a $20.1 billion per year industry by 2025 up from $5.1 billion in 2017, according to a report co-authored by Google. With Southeast Asia s largest economy, Indonesia is likely to account for the majority of that a prior 2015 Google-affiliated report pegging its share of revenue at more than 40 percent. (You can t accuse Google of not doing its homework.) Go-Jek itself was founded in 2011 and it began to make a name for itself a few years ago through its core motorbike tax on-demand service. Bike taxis already exist in many of Southeast Asia s largest cities where they are popular options for cutting through congested streets and getting from A to B faster than four wheels. Go-Jek has since expanded to offer regular taxis, services and shopping on-demand and a mobile payment service, which is being pushed as an offline option too. Its core office is in Jakarta but it has an engineering presence in India. The company is widely thought to be ahead of Grab and Uber in Indonesia, which remains its only market. Uber and Grab both offer similar motorbike taxi options in parts of Southeast Asia, while Grab has also ventured into the mobile payment space. Yesterday, it completed its second acquisition to boost its GrabPay service. Featured Image: BAY ISMOYO/Getty Images\n",

      "Here is an interesting twist: GitLab, which in many ways competes with GitHub as a shared code repository service for teams, is bringing its continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) features to GitHub. The new service is launching today as part of GitLab’s hosted service. It will remain free to developers until March 22, 2019. After that, it’s moving to GitLab.com’s paid Silver tier. GitHub itself offers some basic project and task management services on top of its core tools, but for the most part, it leaves the rest of the DevOps lifecycle to partners. GitLab offers a more complete CI/CD solution with integrated code repositories, but while GitLab has grown in popularity, GitHub is surely better known among developers and businesses. With this move, GitLab hopes to gain new users — and especially enterprise users — who are currently storing their code on GitHub but are looking for a CI/CD solution. The new GitHub integration allows developers to set up their projects in GitLab and connect them to a GitHub repository. So whenever developers push code to their GitHub repository, GitLab will kick off that project’s CI/CD pipeline with automated builds, tests and deployments. Continuous integration and deployment form the backbone of modern DevOps, said Sid Sijbrandij, CEO and co-founder of GitLab. With this new offering, businesses and open source projects that use GitHub as a code repository will have access to GitLab s industry leading CI/CD capabilities. It’s worth noting that GitLab offers a very similar integration with Atlassian’s BitBucket, too.\n",

      "500 Startups may soon be coming up on the one-year mark for the end of a tumultuous saga involving its founder, but its accelerator classes still continue to plug along and its next batch is now getting ready to roll. The firm’s 23rd batch of startups this year consists of the usual mix of business to business and consumer companies (even coffee) that end up in each class. This class is definitely a smaller one, but it still seems to spread a pretty wide number of different verticals. There’s also, of course, a blockchain track for this class, though a small percentage of the startups in it are taking part of that and there was still a certain rigor they had to have to run through it. “For every major tech movement, for every tech phase, there’s the infrastructure phase and the deployment phase,” 500 Startups partner Marvin Laio said. “Our view, with the blockchain, we’re in the infrastructure phase. A lot of these projects outside that we see and read about, they’re kind of bad. They’re really applications. There’s no point having a mobile app if you don’t have the app store. You need to build out the app store. For better or worse, we’re in the infrastructure phase right now.” The firm is still clearly making some pretty big changes, including an unconventional deal with the Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG) that gives it a stake in the firm’s parent company. The terms of that deal weren’t disclosed, it was another move among many by CEO Christine Tsai to begin to rework the mechanics of how the firm works especially as it hopes to succeed as both a venture fund as as a program for entrepreneurs looking to get their companies off the ground. Dave McClure, the firm’s co-founder, resigned last year following allegations of sexual misconduct, and since then it’s been trying to get back to business as usual. 500 Startups takes a similar approach to other accelerators, where they will invest around $150,000 for a small chunk of equity and then take on a small amount of that back (a little more than $37,000) for program fees. The firm has primarily been known for its savvy when it comes to growth and marketing, so the support entrepreneurs get usually has that as a core part of the experience. Here’s the next batch of 500 Startups companies: Chipper A mobile app that helps student loan borrowers pay off debt faster through round ups from everyday transactions and contributions from family and friends.

      "Max Rhodes was walking around that weird little parklet in Hayes Valley in San Francisco after taking a break from a five-year stint at Square to figure out what he wanted to do next and he kept seeing Square registers everywhere. It was spotting them over and over again in smaller retail shops dotted throughout the city that made him think about the connections between the average product maker that kind of small group making a bespoke funny candle and those retailers. That s what prompted him to start Indigo Fair, a platform that connects those two entities in order to streamline the process of getting those products into smaller retail stores that are looking for just those kinds of weird candles throughout major urban areas. The company said it has raised $12 million in new financing from Forerunner Ventures and Khosla Ventures, with Forerunner s Kirsten Green joining the board of directors. I started to think about the fact that you have all these stores adopting cloud-based PoS systems and inventory systems and, generally all their data is becoming available through their media profiles and inventory systems, Rhodes said. If there were some way that you could get all that data and know what is selling where, you could actually predict how well a given product is gonna sell in a store. That was the starting point. As so-called big box shopping increasingly shifts online, the theory is that there will be more and more niche retail outlets looking for interesting products that try to capitalize on the core original shopping experience, which is more social and curated. Indigo Fair receives hundreds of applications from makers every week though, as more and more tools become available to create more complex products, that s probably only going to increase and the team accepts about 5 percent of those applications. Part of the reason is to keep a good handle on the company s growth and still make sure it has that curated feel for retailers, who know they are getting their hands on a good product. They send in some information and then start getting orders, print out a shipping label and then start sending the product out to those retailers. On the retailer end, the shops sign up and immediately have access to those products available through those wholesale makers. Indigo Fair aims to cut out the process of spending tens of thousands of dollars on trips to trade shows with makers to find the right products and then get them in their stores with the hope that they ll sell. If you go into one of the stores on Valencia Street in San Francisco, you ll probably find quite a bit of weird stuff that those stores hope to sell. Indigo Fair looks to try to streamline that process and make it easier to get those products in-house without all the travel and hassle. Of course, even using public data as a starting point, gathering the data to make the model defensible is the harder part. After all, there are a lot of online platforms looking to empower wholesale makers to get their goods into the hands of consumers, though the company today said it s actually partnering with Shopify and Square. But as the company gets more and more information about what s selling, what isn t and who s returning what, it gets a better sense of consumer demand for a product and where to put it to keep the cost for both of those entities down. In so many ways it s the age-old challenge of marketplaces, Green said. I think it requires you to be very scrappy, it requires you to find good customers that believe in the proposition and the potential for the product that they re willing to start working with you in that regard. There is a lot of info you can readily access online today. Just having the patience and the commitment to try to put a bunch of that together on your own platform so you can start building the data set is just some of the heavy lifting involved. Rhodes hope, amid increasing competition and different models and approaches like Simon which wants to help startups get pop-up shops in malls is that with his experience dealing with the problems first-hand, and with enough data, Indigo Fair will become a go-to service for both retailers and product makers. Rhodes, a former consultant at Bain who helped build Square Cash, with his co-founders Marcelo Cortes and Daniele Perito, look to lean on everyone s experience getting an expensive umbrella in stores and selling it across North America to enable every product maker to get the same thing done.\n",

      "Back in 2011, when South Korea won its longshot bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, the country wasn t widely recognized as a destination for ski and snow lovers. It wasn t considered much of a tech startup hub either. Fast forward seven years and a lot has changed. For the next 10 days, the eyes of the world will be on the snowy slopes of PyeongChang. Meanwhile, a couple of hours away in Seoul, a burgeoning startup scene is seeing investments multiply, generating exits and even creating a unicorn or two. While South Korea doesn t get a perfect score as a startup innovation hub, it has established itself as a serious contender. More than half a billion dollars annually has gone to seed through late-stage funding rounds for the past few years. During that time, at least two companies, e-commerce company Coupang and mobile-focused content and commerce company Yello Mobile, have established multi-billion-dollar valuations. To provide a broader picture of how South Korea stacks up in terms of attracting startup investment and building scalable companies, Crunchbase News put together a data dive looking at funding totals, significant investments, exits and active investors. Here are some of our findings. A fast rise Venture funding for South Korean startups started to take off in 2014, per Crunchbase data. Previously, venture funding rounds that made it into the database only totaled in the tens of millions of dollars annually. But about four years ago, the numbers started rising dramatically. In the chart below, we look at the annual totals from 2010 through 2018: Big, later-stage rounds pushed up the totals. In the past four years, more than two dozen companies have closed financings of $10 million or more, including a few unicorns for substantially larger sums. One of those, Coupang, has raised $1.4 billion from venture and private equity investors to date. Totals have trended lower in the past couple of years, which may be attributed to fewer giant rounds. For instance, more than half of the 2015 total came from a $1 billion SoftBank investment in Coupang. Emerging startups While totals are down some over the past few quarters, South Korean startups have continued to attract attention and big checks from both domestic and overseas investors. The largest single funding in the past year went to TMON (short for Ticket Monster), which raised $115 million last April at a reported $1.4 billion valuation. This is the second time scaling up with growth funding, as the Seoul-based company already provided an exit to early investors years ago. Coupon site LivingSocial bought the company in 2011, then sold itself to Groupon, which then spun out the Korean company. After TMON, the next-biggest funding rounds were for travel site Yanolja, which raised $55 million, and Snow, developer of popular selfie apps, which raised $50 million. In the chart below, we look at these and other significant financings from 2017 through today: The list of top funding recipients includes a mix of startups focused principally on the Korean market and those attracting a broad international user base. Companies focused on the domestic market find that Korea, with 50 million inhabitants and a highly urbanized, tech-savvy customer base, is big enough to support massively scalable businesses. Those in that camp include TMON and Coupang. But Korea also has a record of building up major global companies, like Samsung, LG and Hyundai, to name the best known. So it s not surprising to see companies with global ambitions among the top startups. In recent years, the leading Korean search engine, Naver, in particular, has been successful launching startups with global reach. The firm is a majority owner of the Japan-headquartered messaging app LINE, which went public last year and is valued at nearly $10 billion. Line and Naver are also majority owners of Snow. It s also possible to start local and later go global. In this camp is Viva Republica, a developer of a fast-growing mobile payments tool Toss, which got initial traction in Korea and is now setting its sights on expansion abroad. Playing to win Korea s startup scene is attracting a large and diverse collection of investors, including Korea-based funds, corporate VCs, Silicon Valley venture firms and others. A number of firms are repeat investors. Among the most active are Samsung, Altos Ventures, SoftBank Ventures Korea, Formation 8 (now Formation Group and 8VC), 500 Startups and Anchor Equity Partners. The total pool of investors is much deeper, however. Crunchbase data shows that more than 150 angel, seed, incubator and VC and corporate venture investors have participated in funding rounds for Korea-based companies over the past five years. Of course, not all recent bets on promising startups will turn out winners. But all in all, it appears that South Korean entrepreneurs have clearly put together a competitive lineup.

      "You don’t hear of many $2 loans in the United States, where $2 won’t buy you more than a chocolate bar. But in cities like Lagos, Nigeria, and Nairobi, Kenya, $2 has the buying power of roughly $40, making such “micro” loans useful when you’re running a small business. And borrowing $2 from a startup called Branch is a way onto a platform that promises much bigger loans, based on your credit worthiness. What is Branch and why is it bothering with such small amounts of money? For answers to those questions, we talked this week with its founder and CEO Matt Flannery, who previously cofounded and co-led Kiva, a now 14-year-old micro-lending platform that enables families to make small loans to entrepreneurs in developing countries. Flannery realized while running Kiva that a nonprofit — which Kiva is — can only get so far when it comes to fundraising. Meanwhile, fascinated by the spread of smart phones and digital payment systems in Africa, Flannery knew that if he could raise serious capital, he could make even more loans to small business owners without needing to meet and interview them first. In service to that idea, what Branch built is an app that analyzes all kinds of information on a user’s phone that determines how to score their credit. For example, in Nigeria, every time you use an ATM, the bank sends you an SMS message with your bank balance. That’s useful information to Branch. In Kenya, every time you pay your energy bill, the receipt comes via SMS. Knowing if you pay it and how big a bill you’re paying is valuable information, too. Users apparently don’t see the app as invading their privacy — or it’s worth the trade-off to them if they do. Since its 2015 founding, Branch has been downloaded onto more than one million mobile phones in Sub-Saharan Africa, says Flannery. Based on that momentum, Branch has attracted the kind of financial muscle Flannery was seeking when he left Kiva to start the company. In fact, Branch is announcing today that it has lined up $70 million in Series B funding to expand its financial offerings to additional countries, including India. Trinity Ventures led the $20 million equity portion of the round, along with participation from International Finance Corporation, Andreessen Horowitz and CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund. Branch also secured a $50 million debt facility from Victory Park Capital, an investment firm with a focus on alternative credit whose other portfolio companies include LendingClub and LendUp. Altogether, Branch has now raised $80 million. It suggests that lending incremental amounts isn’t just helpful to small business owners in developing countries; there’s a lucrative opportunity in it. “The banking infrastructure in the U.S. is so robust and complete,” says Schwark Satyavolu, the general partner at Trinity Ventures who led the round for his firm. Meanwhile, Branch, he says, “seems like an application of Silicon Valley tech to create financial services. But it’s substantially more interesting, because Branch is doing it in emerging markets where you don’t have a robust stack or credit bureaus or information that’s nearly as rich or as deep as in the Western world.” It’s worth noting that Branch is not a bank, despite that it calls itself a “branchless bank.” Its straightforward terms of use are just one giveaway. Branch charges 15 percent interest on a loan as low as $2 at the end of one month. It also charges a 15 percent APR on its largest loans, which are $1,000 and can be paid over a 12-month period. Branch basically loses money on the $2 loan in order to drum up repeat business — and the strategy is working, according to Flannery. New customers borrow from Branch 20 times on average in the first year after they’ve downloaded the app. If that sounds like a risky proposition for new borrowers, the good news, in our view, is that Branch never charges its users overdraft fees. “I’ve worked in microfinance long enough to know that late fees create a cycle of debt,” Flannery says. What investors like even more is that Branch — which has 100 employees in San Francisco, Lagos, and Nairobi — was profitable before taking on this new funding. It’s also growing 20 percent month over month, and it plans to roll out savings accounts next. “We see savings as a critical next step,” says Flannery. “People typically don’t have them, or the yield is super low to non-existent.” It will be a “big regulatory issue for us,” he says, explaining such accounts could be a year out, based on Branch’s dealings with the banks it needs as partners. It’s worth it, though, he adds. There’s a “big opportunity in these places.”\n",

      "Naspers, the South African tech and media conglomerate, continues to have an incredibly hot hand when it comes to global tech investment. Famous for owning a huge chunk of the Chinese Internet powerhouse, Tencent and a big chunk of Mail.ru, Naspers just made $2.2 billion off of the sale of Flipkart to Walmart. The South African company had an 11.18% stake in Flipkart and the sale represents an IRR of 32%, the company said. Naspers originally backed Flipkart five years after the company’s launch in 2007 and had invested roughly $616 million into the company since that time. Naspers said that proceeds from the sale of Flipkart would be funneled back into the company’s balance sheet to fuel the growth of the company’s own classifieds, online food delivery, and fintech businesses globally. With Flipkart out of the portfolio, Naspers still holds a huge chunk of online tech real estate in India. The company has stakes in PayU, a payment and fintech company; OLX, a classifieds business; the online travel business MakeMyTrip, and Swiggy, a food delivery company.\n",

      "A newly discovered set of vulnerabilities in AMD chips is making waves not because of the scale of the flaws, but rather the rushed, market-ready way in which they were disclosed by the researchers. When was the last time a bug had its own professionally shot video and PR rep, yet the company affected was only alerted 24 hours ahead of time? The flaws may be real, but the precedent set here is an unsavory one. The flaws in question were discovered by CTS Labs, a cybersecurity research outfit in Israel, and given a set of catchy names: Ryzenfall, Masterkey, Fallout and Chimera, with associated logos, a dedicated website and a whitepaper describing them. So far, so normal: major bugs like Heartbleed and of course Meltdown and Spectre got names and logos too. The difference is that in those cases the affected parties, such as Intel, the OpenSSL team and AMD were quietly alerted well ahead of time. This is the concept of “responsible disclosure,” and gives developers first crack at fixing an issue before it becomes public. There’s legitimate debate over just how much control big companies should exert over the publicity of their own shortcomings, but generally speaking in the interest of protecting users the convention tends to be adhered to. In this case, however, the CTS Labs team sprang their flaws on AMD fully formed and with little warning. The flaws discovered by the team are real, though they require administrative privileges to execute a cascade of actions, meaning taking advantage of them requires considerable access to the target system. The research describes some as backdoors deliberately included in the chips by Taiwanese company ASmedia, which partners with many manufacturers to produce components. The access requirement makes these much more limited than the likes of Meltdown and Spectre, which exploited problems at the memory handling and architecture level. They’re certainly serious, but the manner in which they have been publicized has aroused suspicion around the web. Why the extremely non-technical video shot on green screen with stock backgrounds composited in? Why the scare tactics of calling out AMD’s use in the military? Why don’t the bugs have CVE numbers, the standard tracking method for nearly all serious issues? Why was AMD given so little time to respond? Why not, if as the FAQ suggests, some fixes could be created in a matter of months, at least delay the publication until they were available? And what’s with the disclosure that CTS “may have, either directly or indirectly, an economic interest in the performance” of AMD? That’s not a common disclosure in situations like this. (I’ve contacted the PR representative listed for the flaws [!] for answers to some of these questions.) It’s hard to shake the idea that there’s some kind of grudge against AMD at play. That doesn’t make the flaws any less serious, but it does leave a bad taste in the mouth. AMD issued a statement saying that “We are investigating this report, which we just received, to understand the methodology and merit of the findings.” Hard to do much else in a day. As always with these big bugs, the true extent of their reach, how serious they really are, whether users or businesses will be affected and what they can do to prevent it are all information yet to come as experts pore over and verify the data.\n",

      "America delivered more AR/VR revenue than China last year, but Chinese growth in the next five years could see it dominate AR/VR long-term — and not by a small margin. With the potential to take more than $1 of every $5 spent on AR/VR globally by 2022, the natural advantages of the Chinese AR/VR market are a golden opportunity (or threat) for domestic and international players. Combine China with other major countries in the region, and Asia could deliver around half of AR/VR global revenue in five years time. Western companies might need to adopt a we try harder approach to compete at the same level. Since 2015 we ve said that ubiquitous AR could dominate focused VR long-term. While the two markets might merge into unified XR (or some other acronym) one day, they could have very different dynamics for the foreseeable future. AR (mobile AR, smart glasses) could approach 3.5 billion installed base and $85 billion to $90 billion revenue by 2022, while VR (console, PC, mobile, standalone) might deliver 50 to 60 million installed base and $10 billion to $15 billion revenue in the same time frame. (Note: Digi-Capital s base case is that even with 900 million installed base for ARKit/ARCore by the end of this year, AR/VR revenue will only start to scale in 2019.) To understand what s happening across the 55 major AR/VR countries and regions, let s start with VR. America might win the battle for VR VR s smaller installed base, lower mobility and exclusive immersion (i.e. limited plurality) focuses it on entertainment use cases and revenue streams. Entertainment (games, location-based entertainment, video) could take two-thirds of VR sector revenue long-term, with hardware taking just over a quarter due to limited unit sales and price competition. The VR market s country dynamics have much in common with the wider video games market. The U.S. has a significant installed base of Sony s VR capable games consoles (banned in China until recently) and high-end VR-capable PCs. It also has highly profitable core gamer economics, which could give it an advantage if premium standalone VR (neither PC nor mobile tethered) hits its stride in a few years. While China has a much larger mobile installed base, mobile/standalone VR s trajectory took a fundamental hit last year, following the launch of mass-market mobile AR. Combined with lower ARPU for mobile/standalone VR, China is at a relative disadvantage to the West on a per user basis. The U.S. could take around one-fifth of global VR revenue by 2022, making it slightly larger than China. But while the U.S. could win the VR battle, it might be a small victory. Combining China with other countries in the region (particularly Japan and South Korea), Asia could deliver just under half of global VR revenue in five years — over twice North America. Europe (led by the U.K., Germany, France) could also deliver, but the European region combined might only be slightly larger than either the U.S. or China individually. China could win the war with AR The dynamics of AR look very different. An installed base in the billions is coming for mobile AR. If and when Apple launches smartphone-tethered smart glasses (we ve been forecasting 2020 for a while now), that market could grow from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions installed base in five years. Because of this distribution potential, a Cambrian explosion of new use cases and business cases is beginning to emerge. E-commerce sales (goods & services, not IAP), hardware sales, ad spend, app store (non-games and games), enterprise and location-based entertainment hold significant promise for AR long-term. So where VR looks like a subset of the games market, AR s long-term dynamics could be more like mobile. That s where China s natural advantages give it the edge over every other country on the planet (including the U.S.). Chinese ARCore could have an installed base approaching ARKit’s scale globally long-term. Add to that ARKit itself in China, plus domestic Chinese mobile AR from Tencent, Alibaba and others, and a clearer picture of Chinese scale emerges. Then from 2020, smartphone-tethered smart glasses could become premium peripherals to Apple and others phones, again leveraging China s inherent mobile strength. This could see China dominate global mobile AR and smart glasses’ installed bases long-term. Then there s China s market dynamics, business models and economics to consider: What does all this mean for AR? E-commerce could be the largest AR business model, where China (particularly Alibaba) might dominate. Smart glasses hardware sales could come next, with premium Chinese iPhone users core to Apple s potential long-term smart glasses dominance (whether they call them iGlasses or not). Tencent is in prime position for the third-largest business model of AR advertising, which explains its battles with Alibaba (although Facebook Camera Effects could generate more revenue internationally). And that s not to mention Chinese iOS and Android AR app store revenues (both non-games and games), enterprise AR and location-based AR entertainment at scale. Combining China s impending AR installed base, business models and economics, and it could see nearly one-quarter of all AR revenues globally by 2022. This is almost half again what the U.S. might produce in a similar time frame. Merging all the country data for a regional view, and Asia could take more than half, Europe less than one-quarter and North America less than one-fifth of global AR revenues. It s a small world after all Installed bases, use cases and economics are great levelers in tech markets, and so it is for AR/VR. While the U.S. might win VR, China could dominate much larger AR. So whoever wins AR also wins AR/VR globally — right now that looks like China by a country mile. This is not to say that the U.S. and other western countries can t do very well from AR/VR long-term (indeed, we forecast that they should). However Asia, China in particular, is critical to the future of the market. Global players need to find a way to compete, or risk being left behind. While Apple could do well as always, for everyone else it s all to play for.\n",

      "Teatime Games, a new Icelandic “social games” startup from the same team behind the hugely popular QuizUp (acquired in by Glu Mobile), is disclosing $9 million in funding, made up of seed and Series A rounds. Index Ventures led both, but have been joined by Atomico, the European VC fund founded by Skype’s Niklas Zennstr m, for the $7.5 million Series A round. I understand this is the first time the two VC firms have done a Series A deal together in over a decade. Both VCs have a decent track record in gaming. Index counts King, Roblox and Supercell as previous gaming investments, whilst Atomico also backed Supercell, along with Rovio, and most recently Bossa Studios. As part of the round, Guzman Diaz of Index Ventures, Mattias Ljungman of Atomico, and David Helgason, founder of Unity, have joined the Teatime Games board of directors. Meanwhile, Teatime Games is keeping shtum publicly on exactly what the stealthy startup is working on, except that it plays broadly in the social and mobile gaming space. In a call with co-founder and CEO Thor Fridriksson yesterday, he said a little more off the record and on condition that I don’t write about it yet. What he was willing to describe publicly, however, is the general problem the company has set out to solve, which is how to make mobile games more social and personalised. Specifically, in a way that any social features — including communicating with friends and other players in real-time — enhances the gameplay rather than gets in its way or is simply bolted on as an adjunct to the game itself. The company’s macro thesis is that games have always been inherently social throughout different eras (e.g. card games, board games, arcades, and consoles), and that most games truly come to life “through the interaction between people, opponents, and the audience”. However, in many respects this has been lost in the age of mobile gaming, which can feel like quite a solitary experience. That’s either because they are single player games or turn-based and played against invisible opponents. Teatime plans to use the newly-disclosed investment to double the size of its team in Iceland, with a particular focus on software engineers, and to further develop its social gaming offering for third party developers. Yes, that’s right, this is clearly a developer platform play, as much as anything else. On that note, Atomico Partner Mattias Ljungman says the next “breakout opportunity” in games will see a move beyond individual studios and titles to what he describes as fundamental enabling technologies. Linked to this he argues that the next generation of games companies being developed will “become ever more mass market and socially connected”. You can read much more on Ljungman and Atomico’s gaming thesis in a blog post recently published by the VC firm.\n",

      "The NFL season ends tonight with the New England Patriots losing to facing off against the Philadelphia Eagles in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The game starts at 6:30pm ET / 3:30pm PT and this year will be aired on NBC, meaning if you have cable or an HD antenna you can just tune into NBC to watch. If you want to watch it on a device like a phone, tablet or smart TV you can download the NBC app or NBC sports app. Usually these require authenticating with your cable login, but for the Super Bowl anyone will be able to watch without logging in. And this year for the first time you can watch the game on your phone even if you don t have Verizon, either via one of the above mentioned apps or on the NFL Mobile app and the Yahoo Sports app. If you re on the web you can also just stream the game at nbc.com or nbcsports.com. And if you re outside the U.S you can check out the NFL s website here to see streaming options depending on your country. Overall this is probably the best year yet in terms of how easy it is to watch the game, especially considering that mobile streaming is no longer limited to those with a Verizon phone plan. Lastly, if you re looking for some new living room tech to watch the game on we put together a guide of the ultimate Super Bowl smart hub set up that you can check out here.

      "Just in time for the World Cup, Telemundo Deportes, Universal Brand Development and the startup TreasureHunt, have launched a shootout game for the Instant Games platform on Facebook and Messenger. Telemundo Deportes is putting out the game in conjunction with its Spanish-language coverage of 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia. GOAL! SHOOTOUT (WHICH IS CLEARLY VERY EXCITING) lets players vie for the title of penalty kick all star so they can all bend it like the virtual Beckhams that they are. The World Cup provides us with the opportunity to tap into the passion of soccer and engage with our viewers in different, authentic ways leading up to and throughout the tournament this summer, said Miguel Lorenzo, Director, Digital Product Development, Telemundo Deportes, in a statement. We are excited to launch this collaborative initiative with Universal Brand Development, which is Telemundo Deportes first release in the games space, and we look forward to offering a high quality social gaming experience for our soccer fans. Through the game, folks get points by successfully taking penalty kicks. Over the course of the Cup, which runs from today through July 15, players can perfect their technique by practicing against special targets, unlock new designs for soccer balls and challenge friends to beat scores. At Universal, we want to offer games wherever people want to play them, so we are thrilled to be launching our first game on Messenger, said Chris Heatherly, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Games and Digital Platforms, Universal Brand Development, in a statement. The free-to-play game developed with TreasureHunt has to be one of the biggest opportunities yet for the young, Berlin-based startup. It was only last June that the company raised $6 million in its first institutional round of financing led by The Gauselmann Group, a Germany gaming company, with participation from angel investors. For Kyle Smith, the leader of TreasureHunt’s team of veteran game developers from companies like Electronic Arts, Zynga, Rovio and King, the goal was to appeal to the widest possible audience. We really wanted to capture the momentum leading up to Telemundo s coverage of the World Cup by creating a highly social, super accessible game that can be enjoyed by sports fans anywhere, said Kyle Smith, CEO, TreasureHunt. Our goal was to create an experience that appeals to a mainstream audience by making them feel part of this historic worldwide tournament. The free to play GOAL! SHOOTOUT is out now.

      "Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds, the ‘battle royale’ style game where everyone tries to be the last player standing while scrounging for supplies to keep them alive, has launched on Android in Canada MobileSyrup reports, which could presage a future release in the U.S. The arrival of the mobile version of the game more generally known as PUBG coincides with it reaching the 5 million player milestone on Xbox, where it’s been available since late last year after debuting on the PC in early access earlier in 2017. It’s not cross-play compatible, unlike Fortnite, however, so if you’re playing the Android version you’ll be matched up against others with the app, which is published by Chinese Internet giant Tencent. This Android port wasn’t developed by original PUBG studio Bluehole, but they say they oversaw the creation of this mobile version. Based on early testing with a Pixel 2 XL, it looks and feels a lot like the original. PUBG doesn’t have quite the hype of Fortnite right now, since that’s begun a cross-platform play mobile beta and also Drake just played a session with one of the most popular professional esports players in the world. But a mobile version close at hand (and available now, if you’re Canadian) is reason to get excited.\n",

      "Snapchat wants to let you play its augmented reality Lenses, not just play dress-up. Today it launched Snappables — AR games that use your touch, motion, and facial expressions to compete for high scores or in literal head-to-head multiplayer matchups. Snappables live alongside Snapchat’s other Lenses and are rolling out globally this week. New games will be released each week while favorites will stick around. These are Snapchat’s first collaborative or shared Lenses that let you interact with another friend on their own phone, which could open up new opportunities for the app in the future. Some of the first Snappables previewed by Snapchat include an Asteroids-style space shooter, a bubble gum popping contest, a weight lifting one you play by straining your forehead, a kiss-blowing game, an egg catching competition, and a dance party. The Killer Features blog first spotted Snappables in Snapchat’s code, though originally thought it was a collaborative Snap creation option. Snapchat acquired game engine PlayCanvas last month but it’s unclear if that contributed to the Snappables experience. The games look similar to Tribe’s multiplayer selfie video chat games we wrote about this month and predicted Snapchat would copy. These aren’t Snapchat’s first selfie games, though. Back in 2016, it tried a Kraft Mac & Cheese noodle catching game, and a holiday elf skiing game that used your face. It’s also worked with partners like Gatorade to build ads the open up to interactive experiences that live inside Snapchat, like a Serena Williams tennis game. To play Snappables, you select one of the game Lenses from the Snapchat camera and then follow the on-screen instructions. Some you play solo and try to get the highest score, while others let you invite friends to play simultaneously. You can send a Snap of you playing to a friend, which they can use to jump in and play too. Snapchat could use Snappables to strengthen growth after years of battling Instagram for users, and a big redesign that’s received harsh reviews. I can imagine more art-based co-creation Snappables coming in the future where you cooperate to create a masterpiece. Of course, Instagram probably won’t be far behind in offering games inside Stories. If the goal of apps like Snapchat is to make people feel like they’re together even when they’re apart, games could help achieve that feeling of co-presence. Sometimes you don’t have anything to talk about or show off. That’s partly why Snapchat got into augmented reality in the first place — to make life more interesting and shareable. But with the challenge, competition, and excitement inherent in games, Snappables could help people make memories together no matter the distance in between. Here’s more video and photos showing off Snappables:\n",

      "Bossa Studios, the London gaming startup backed by Atomico and behind popular titles ‘Surgeon Simulator’ and ‘I am Bread’, is embarking on its biggest and most ambitious project yet. Described as a “Community-Crafted MMO,” where players have literally co-built the game’s environment and will continue to do so, Worlds Adrift sees its wider public outing today via the Steam Early Access program. The new game, which has been three years in the making and was born out of a Bossa Studios “game jam,” akin to the kinds of internal ‘hackathons’ many startups routinely hold, is attempting to pull off a number of firsts. For starters (and probably most noteworthy to TechCrunch readers), it was the first game built on top of Improbable’s SpatialOS, the cloud-based platform for creating games and other virtual environments that need to go beyond the limitations of traditional server architectures. Improbable raised a whopping $502 million last May from Softbank and existing investors at a $1 billion-plus valuation, and so — inadvertently, at least — likely has quite a lot riding on Worlds Adrift. For the Bossa Studios team, the stakes are even higher. Improbable’s tech isn’t exactly proven and, in comparison, Bossa Studios is a smaller and much less well-funded startup attempting to punch way above its weight, even if the team has a lot of gaming industry pedigree. In a video call with two of its founders, Roberta Lucca and Henrique Olifiers, they were visibly excited by the launch but conceded a large amount of pre-launch nerves. When the Worlds Adrift concept was first conceived during that soon-to-be infamous game jam several years ago, it was indefinitely put on hold due to being far too ambitious per the size of the company. A chance meeting with Improbable some time later — where I’m told the two young companies were introduced somewhat serendipitously through having the same PR agency — it became clear that it might just be possible. In the coming weeks and months, Bossa Studios will find out if that bet, which meant redirecting all of the startup’s resources into by far its largest undertaking, has likely paid off. The other first, explained Lucca and Olifiers, is the sheer open-ended, community-driven and ‘persistent’ scale of the game. Tapping into the ‘makers’ trend, early testers of Worlds Adrift have shaped the game itself via Bossa s Island Creator tool. This has seen 10,000 designs submitted, and Worlds Adrift is launching with 300 ‘floating islands,’ nearly all of which have been created by the community rather than Bossa Studios staff. Related to this and enabled by the scalable nature of SpatialOS, every aspect of Worlds Adrift is ‘persistent,’ meaning that an object’s current physical status persists in realtime, relative to how or when it was last interacted with, either by a player or the game’s own persistent physics. If, for example, a ship is blown up and its pieces scattered across the ground, it will remain that way indefinitely unless another player, object or the environment it resides in disturbs it. In addition, the employment of SpatialOS means that players don’t need to be segregated into cohorts based on region and/or distance to a specific set of servers and instead can all play in the same world and at the same time. “Every player globally will be able to interact with each other and every action by every player will have a lasting impact and be visible to every other player inside the game forever,” is how Bossa Studios explains it. At scale, opened-ended, and with player versus player gameplay increasing exponentially as the Worlds Adrift launch ramps up, even its makers aren’t sure how these dynamics will play out. “Offering an entirely user-generated environment, with a completely unscripted style of play, the sheer scale of its scope, and beauty of its design, is an invitation to experiment. Bound only by the laws of physics, the sky truly is the limit,” reads the game’s blurb. On that note, I wasn’t able to play the game — yet — namely because it runs on Windows and I only have access to a Mac. However, Bossa have kindly invited me to their next game jam and to spend some time up close with Worlds Adrift and its makers. If I’m to join in on the jam, I’m ready to pitch my idea for an adventure game starring a guy in a wheelchair wearing a hat who has to navigate a dystopian future rife with inaccessibility, bureaucracy and government cuts, all the while holding down a job as a tech journalist-cum-private investigator. I think it could be a hit.\n",

      "With the NFL season now over, players finally have time to focus on their passions and side projects, which can be anything from an externship on Capital Hill to angel investing in startups. Some of these activities are facilitated through the NFL Player s Association, which actually runs a tech accelerator designed to trade player licensing rights for equity. The accelerator is called One Team Collective, and is run by an executive board made up of leaders from the tech industry as well as a player advisory board with nine current and former NFL players. Founded about a year ago, the group has invested in four startups: WHOOP, StatMuse, Rep the Squad and CampusLore. To kick off 2018, the accelerator released a list of the top five tech trends they think will be big in 2018, and we talked to Ahmad Nassar, chairman of the accelerator, to give us some context about how these trends will be important for the football world. 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Speech analytics, computer vision and deep learning will personalize fan experiences, while players seek the best possible performance avenues in the athletic arena. The group has already invested in one AI-focused startup, which is StatMuse. The startup is essentially a sports statistics database that can be queried by natural language processing, and it also answers questions using the voice of your favorite athlete. While StatMuse is a fan-focused application of artificial intelligence, Nassar noted that they re excited to see how AI can help optimize player performance by doing things like creating custom workout or nutrition schedules. 2. Blockchain Distributed ledgers, the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, have garnered a tremendous number of headlines and have the potential to disrupt mega-industries, including finance, data analytics/security and transaction settlement by eliminating transactional fraud. The application of blockchain is limitless with respect to any type of data management/transactional architecture and will have meaningful application to athlete-driven data. To address the elephant in the room, Nassar immediately explained that the group is cognizant that everyone and their mothers currently think blockchain is today s hot technology. He was quick to make a distinction between what he called pop-crypto, which in his opinion draws parallels to the internet bubble, and real blockchain technology, which has the opportunity to change the way we work with data. Nassar mentioned that WHOOP, a portfolio company that collects athlete performance data via a wearable, could be a beneficiary of blockchain technology. Essentially the group wants to be open-minded and look for opportunities where blockchain technology can benefit the companies with which they re working. 3. Customer Experience (CX) Technologies integrating cyber with the physical to connect people, places and objects with data. Applications for robust CX will augment and transform everyday experiences, including the fan experience. Nassar and the group are excited about how technology can help improve the customer (i.e. fan) experience. He noted that they ve had some interesting discussions with AR companies that are building products to make fan interaction even stronger during and after games, and mentioned Pok mon GO as a product that successfully used AR to create a great customer experience. 4. Cybersecurity Cybersecurity, data theft and fraud are top concerns for customers, corporations and athletes. These privacy fears are resulting in more hesitation to use digital tools, meaning this is an area where solutions are critical and the market is ripe for innovation. While cybersecurity is less applicable to football when compared the other categories, the group still recognizes a huge market opportunity for innovative cybersecurity tech, and will look to get involved when they see an opportunity that makes sense. 5. Consumer Product Innovation Companies that embrace new technologies in nutrition, activewear, consumables and fanwear will gain competitive advantage and fuel the future fan and athlete. This is similar to customer experience, but instead focuses on tangible goods and consumables that are designed to help the fan experience. One interesting company in this category that the group has already invested in is Rep The Squad, a subscription service to borrow expensive authentic sports jerseys. It s the perfect example of new technology (subscription and logistics) helping transform an old experience (wearing jerseys to games). Ultimately, one year in the accelerator has done a great job at getting the NFLPA (and the players they represent) more involved in the tech and startup world just look at how many more players are learning about and investing in startups, both through the NFLPA and on their own. According to Nassar, this increased involvement sets up the NFLPA for an opportunity to put their thumb on the scale [in the tech industry] in a way that is helpful to members going forward.\n",

      "The Super Bowl is over and the stadiums across the country that once held thousands of fans on any given Sunday will be mostly empty in the off-season, but Tom Brady is still at work. The quarterback who will undeniably go down in NFL history as one of the greatest of all time, is already thinking about his next act. Alongside Michael Strahan (another football great who has made the transition into pop cultural icon) and Gotham Chopra the producer, director, and former war correspondent Brady is launching a new sports media startup. Called The Religion of Sports the new startup, which is seeking around $3 million in outside capital, is neither The Players Tribune, Derek Jeter s media platform for athletes to tell their own stories, nor TraceMe, Russell Wilson s access-focused app for athletes and celebrities. Instead, Brady, Strahan and Chopra, alongside chief executive Ameeth Sankaran, a former investor with a family office out of Texas and longtime friend of Chopra s, want to create a multi-platform storytelling business that functions like an old-school studio dedicated to sports that tells the best stories in the medium that s most appropriate for them. If this seems like a thesis in search of a technology platform, that s because it is, but it s impossible to discount the rolodexes that Strahan, Brady, and Chopra (the son of Deepak Chopra) have on hand and the power that their network can wield. It s also impossible to discount their dedication to sports and the stories that can be told through the lens of players and their fans. For Strahan, who has already made the jump to becoming a capital C celebrity, this is another hyphen to add to his multi-hyphenate career of all-star-talk-show-host-business-mogul, but for Brady, who may retire as soon as the end of next season (if the Pats make another Super Bowl appearance) there s definitely a sense of what will come next. The crew first came together around five years ago when Brady met Chopra in Los Angeles. I think in our very first meeting, he shared with me the idea of Religion of Sports, and I was hooked immediately!, Brady wrote in an email. Over the next few years, Gotham and I continued the conversation and the friendship evolved very naturally from there. Strahan had enjoyed a long-standing friendship with Brady and through mutual friends was connected with Chopra who floated the idea of the company to him. The idea resonated. I love the storytelling aspect and being able to produce content that s different and inspiring, Strahan wrote in an email. While both Brady and Strahan are among the greatest athletes to play the game of football, Chopra brings the eye, and mind of the ultimate fan. For him, the inspiration for the company goes back to something out of a Norman Rockwell illustration. Picture an immigrant father and his young son sitting in the stands at Fenway Park, watching the Red Sox take the field. That experience, and the sense of community that it instilled, became a focal point for the younger Chopra and a theme that would recur again and again in his work. Over a succession of Diet Cokes at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel one afternoon earlier this year, Chopra and Sankaran laid out their vision for the company. As more and more momentum was created around The Religion of Sports show, Gotham became convinced that it was more than a show it was a movement, Sankaran said. Our first step was to make Tom and Michael not executive producers in the show but partners in the business. Think of it as a new media contender to old line properties like ESPN with celebrity athletes and producers driving the creation of new properties. We re hearing in the marketplace an openness for experimentation [and] we re willing to be innovative around what a business model will look like, Sankaran says. For Chopra, sports is the ultimate non-denominational church and the narratives that are spun through its lens around mythical heroes like Strahan and Brady who perform Herculean feats, or the pilgrimages that fans take to the stadium on game day, hold the same significance as any other liturgy. His partners in the endeavor feel the same. I ve always seen sports as an incredible form of community and way to express yourself, so I was excited by the potential of the Religion of Sports to have a major hand in expanding that, writes Brady. I hope our stories empower people to look at life and the world of sports in a deeper and more positive way. As the mechanics and technologies for storytelling evolve, it presents an opportunity for new business models to emerge, Sankaran says. And Brady, Strahan and Chopra are already taking advantage of new mediums for developing and distributing the stories they want to tell. There s already the Religion of Sports series on Showtime and the blockbuster success of the company s latest endeavor the Facebook distributed (and pretty masterful) Tom vs. Time series. The series already racked up over 42 million views on Facebook a little more than one third of the total viewership of this years Super Bowl and additional projects like Why We Fight (with TechCrunch s parent-parent company, Verizon) and one currently in production on the 2018 NBA Draft should also rack up the views. In some senses Religion of Sports is trying to upend the idea of a network in the same way that Players Tribune has. The internet has given a means for any group equipped with enough of a following and the means to produce quality content to set themselves up as a new take on the ESPN model. You don t need a channel because the site and its attendant mobile app are the channel existing alongside other methods for distribution. Storytelling has become about format (long form vs. short form) rather than the screen on which its presented. And companies predicated on storytelling won t replace traditional networks and other outlets but work with them from a position of power and exist alongside them. I think a lot of people feel that traditional networks and other media outlets are a dying breed and they are going down because you have all of these new mediums out today, Strahan writes. Networks, brands and other franchises have already diversified themselves to adapt to the way information is given out now today. I think these companies are smart and run by smart individuals who understand that things are changing but there are certain aspects that possibly won t change and they are going to hold on to those as well. Brady says that new challengers are definitely going to emerge, and that he wants his shot to be among them. Traditional networks and brands have so much experience and traction in the storytelling space that I see most of them being major leaders for a very long time to come, but I think some new players will definitely continue to push them!, he wrote. In general, I think the most authentic and emotionally engaging storytelling will rise to the top. 0 SHARES\n",

      "NBA stars are not afraid to speak their minds. They have worn \"I can't breathe\" shirts during pregame warm-ups to support the Black Lives Matter movement. LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, while onstage at the ESPYs in July 2016, decried police shootings of people of color, and spoke out about racial tensions in the United States. James called President Donald Trump \"a bum,\" while Steph Curry called him an asset \"if you remove the 'et' from asset.\" NBA players have a reputation as being more vocal on social and political issues than any other group of professional athletes. And there's a reason for that. \"Just look at the players who become stars in the NBA. They're very diverse,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, in an exclusive interview with CNN. \"I think part of the reason NBA players are more active is that it's been part of the culture of this league for generations and passed down to them.\" Silver said the \"sense of an obligation, social responsibility, a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important\" is something that's been passed down over the decades. It's \"part of being an NBA player.\" He used the example of Hall-of-Famer Bill Russell, who was very engaged with social causes and in combating racism. \"Fifty-five years ago he played in our All-Star game in Los Angeles and was the MVP. That was 1963. It was also the same year as Martin Luther King's \"I Have A Dream\" speech in Washington D.C. that Bill Russell attended,\" Silver said. \"I think about that through line from Bill Russell right through to 2018 and LeBron James.\" Silver said the league wants NBA players to \"be multi-dimensional people and fully participate as citizens.\" He noted that while it's not his job to spur players to activism he has to make sure they feel \"safe\" to speak out without fearing for their careers. That's a luxury not every league can offer. In the NFL, for example, former quarterback Colin Kaepernick started a protest in 2016 to shed light on the treatment of black Americans, particularly by police. The protest took the form of kneeling during the performance of the National Anthem, which caused substantial controversy for the league. He has yet to be picked up by another team since waiving his contract with the 49ers in 2017. Related: NBA Commish on why the NBA didn't televise the All-Star Game draft NBA players' long-stanging attitude toward social activism has lined up with the changing expectations of some big corporations. More companies, including the NBA, are taking a stand. \"All CEOs, all big corporations these days really have no choice,\" Silver said. \"It's an expectation from their customers that they're going to take a position.\" He said that in the past the advice was to generally avoid taking a position and being too controversial. \"I've talked to lots of CEOs, corporate leaders in other industries,\" he said, \"and I think increasingly their view is they are forced sometimes, as uncomfortable as that may be, to take a position on important things that are happening in society. It doesn't mean you have to touch every issue and there may still be some third rails out there.\" Under Silver's leadership the NBA pulled the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte, North Carolina over a law restricting bathroom use for transgender people that was widely criticized as discriminatory. \"I think in this day and age, you really do have to stand for something,\" Silver said. It's commonly accepted that NBA fans, like the players they cheer for, are typically more diverse than those of other sports. Silver noted that NBA fans tend to embrace many of the same values that the league has advocated for, including anti-discrimination policies. \"I think ultimately to the extent we're a brand -- there's an NBA brand -- I think that us upholding those values is good business because I think it's consistent with how people see our brand,\" he said. Related: NBA working with players to head off national anthem tensions Silver also talked about how basketball plays into the American Dream. \"Twenty-five percent of our players in the league are from outside the United States,\" he said. \"The U.S. has opened its borders to them based on their ability to do something at an incredibly high level. To me it's the ultimate meritocracy.\"\n",

      "Days after Disney-owned ESPN launched its new streaming service, ESPN+, a three-year old streaming TV service for sports fans, fuboTV, is announcing the close of $75 million in Series D funding. The round included new investor AMC Networks, and existing investors 21st Century Fox, Luminari Capital, Northzone, Sky, and the former Scripps Networks Interactive, which was recently acquired by Discovery, Inc. FuboTV has been working to carve out a niche for itself in the streaming TV market, where a number of competitors are delivering television programming to cord cutters by way of the internet. In terms of subscribers, that space today is led by Dish’s Sling TV and AT&T’s newer DirecTV Now. But the market has also seen a lot of newcomers over the past year or so, with launches from Hulu’s Live TV, YouTube TV, and Philo. PlayStation Vue is a competitor as well, while CBS runs its own over-the-top streaming TV service with just its content, CBS All Access. While many streaming TV services offer some sports content in their base packages, or sell additional access through add-ons, fuboTV’s core focus has been on serving the sports fan. The service provides access to live games from the NBA, NHL, UFC, and more soccer than other streaming providers – including matches from Bundesliga, EPL and La Liga to Liga MX, MLS, FIFA World Cup qualifiers, UEFA Champions League matches and more. That access doesn’t come cheap, however. FuboTV’s basic package with 70-plus channels, Fubo Premier, is $19.99 for the first month, which then becomes $44.99 per month after. Customers can then customize their package with other options, like a “Sports Plus,” “Adventure Plus,” or “International Sports Plus” upgrade; a DVR with 500 hours of storage instead of just 30; or the option to add a third stream. Even though the entry-level package is more than a full subscription to a mainstream service like Sling TV or YouTube TV, fuboTV managed to reach over 100,000 paid subscribers as of September 2017, and is continuing to see double-digit growth, it says. Since the last funding round ten months ago, the company has streamed its first MLB All Star Game, Playoffs and World Series; Tour de France; NFL regular season, playoffs and Super Bowl; college football; and the Winter Olympic Games. And it has exited beta on Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, iOS and Android; revamped its user interface; and debuted new features like “Lookback” and “Startover.” The lineup it offers has begun to broaden beyond sports in recent months, as well. While it has added several new sports additions in the last ten months, it has added entertainment networks, too – including those from its strategic investors. These include AMC, BBC AMERICA, CBS, CBS Sports Network, CBSN, Food Network, FUSION TV, HGTV, IFC, MSG, MSG+, NESN, NFL Network, Pac-12 Network, Pop, SNY, SundanceTV, The Olympic Channel, Travel Channel and WE tv. Combined, fuboTV offers viewers over 30,000 sporting events per year, 10,000+ titles in its video-on-demand library. In addition, fuboTV has been adding broadcast affiliates and now offers Fox in 87 percent of U.S. households, and NBC and CBS in 72 percent and 68 percent, respectively. In total, it has 257 local broadcast affiliates and owned-and-operated stations on the service. FuboTV doesn’t just generate revenue from subscriptions, however – it also sells advertising. The company tells TechCrunch it’s forecasting a revenue run rate of over $100 million by this time next year. “We are very bullish from an ad perspective, even though we only launched server-side ad insertion in January,” notes fuboTV co-founder and CEO David Gandler. “One quarter in, advertising represents low single-digit percentage of our overall revenue, but it is growing quickly. As a benchmark, we are already experiencing ad revenue per subscriber above Spotify s recently published ad revenue per user data,” he says. With the new investment, fuboTV plans to double its office space and engineers and product team, and open a second headquarters. The funding will also be used to develop new products and content offerings, and for marketing. Correction, 4/18/18, 4 PM ET: AMC participated and is a new investor; AMC did not lead the round.

      "Nintendo has finally revealed the details of its paid online service after months of speculation by fans. The pricing is pretty much as expected ($20 per year), but the additions of online save game backups and NES games with added online multiplayer sweeten the deal. We first heard the pricing last June, including the $3.99 monthly and $7.99 3-month options, but the announcement then left much to the imagination. This one makes things much clearer, but there are still a few mysteries it will perhaps clear up at E3 or closer to the September launch. Save data being backed up online is perhaps the most asked-for feature on the Switch, and one other platforms have provided for years. So its official announcement will surely be greeted with cries of joy. The exact details are coming soon. But it’s the online play for NES games that really caught my eye. Officially called “NES Nintendo Switch Online,” it will be a collection of 10 games to start and 10 more to come, all of which can be played in both single- and multi-player modes online. How that looks exactly isn’t quite clear; the Nintendo release says “Depending on the game, players can engage in online competitive or co-op multiplayer, or take turns controlling the action.” Does that mean we’ll have leaderboards? Ghost runs in Super Mario Bros 3? Low-latency battles in Balloon Fight? No clue. At least the first 10 games are confirmed: Balloon Fight, Dr. Mario and Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Ice Climber, The Legend of Zelda, Mario Bros., Soccer, Super Mario Bros. and Tennis. The other 10 will supposedly be announced soon, with more added “on a regular basis.” Those are of course all Nintendo-made games, suggesting licensing negotiations are still underway for classics like Final Fantasy and Double Dragon. For now it’s a package deal, you can’t just buy Soccer and play it unless you go for the full online experience. The $20 per year subscription will also be necessary starting in September for online play. It might be a bit much to ask if you don’t play a lot of Splatoon or Mario Kart 8 or aren’t so into retro NES games, but it’s sure cheaper than the competition. If you want to talk with your friends while trading off Zelda dungeons, you’ll still need the smartphone app, though. Perhaps a chat service will be announced another time. A couple technical notes: the subscription is tied to an account, not the hardware, so if you and I shared a Switch and only I paid for the online aspect, you don’t get it when you log in. On the other hand, when I go to a friend’s house, I can log in to their device and use online services there. There is a $35 yearly option that lets you authorize up to 8 accounts though, for families with multiple users. The Switch Online service isn’t needed for system updates or buying games online or anything just online play, the NES games, and save game backups.\n",

      "Today marks the 52nd Super Bowl, and quite a bit has changed since that first big game. Then, it was called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game. In 1967, the cost of a movie ticket was $1.25, and color TV was just starting to become popular. Today, more than fifty years later, we can now stream the big game to our pocket computers and have artificially intelligent assistants sitting around in our homes to keep us up to date on predictions. That said, the three big voice assistants seem to have a different approach on predicting who will win the Super Bowl today. Apple s Siri is playing it straight. When asked who will win the Super Bowl, she simply responds with data: I m hearing that the Patriots are favored to beat the Eagles by 4.5 points. Google Assistant, on the other hand, doesn t seem to want to plant a flag in the sand. The voice-powered AI has a few different responses to the question of who will win the big game, each less informative than the last. Both teams are hungry for victory, which is important. While the players will be leaving everything on the field, I want you to leave nothing in the chip bowl. All I can say is it s going to be fierce. At some point, both quarterbacks will yell Kill! Kill! Kill! and call an audible, but don t be afraid. You re not in any danger. I don t have any answers but I can confidently say this: I predict a touchdown within the first sixty minutes. In each of these three responses, the voice of Google Assistant is accompanied by roaring crowds. Which, let s be honest, makes these responses even more ridiculous. This brings us, finally, to Amazon Echo. When asking Alexa who will win the Super Bowl, Amazon has decided to take their voice assistant in a more human direction. Pats fans, brace yourselves! The team favored to win is the (cough). Is the (cough). Excuse me. Is the Patriots. (Clears throat.) That was tough to get out. But I m flying with the Eagles on this one because of their relentless defense and the momentum they ve been riding off their underdog status. E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles! Funny enough, Amazon is anything but an underdog and more aptly represented by the Patriots than by the Eagles. But, in any case, you should have some fun chatting it up with your favorite AI before the game. Unless it s Siri. That s just boring. Featured Image: Getty Images\n",

      "For the first time ever, Fortnite Battle Royale players have the chance to compete with one another for a huge amount of V-Bucks, the game’s virtual currency. Fortnite Battle Royale often adds new wacky game modes, like 50 vs 50 or the much-memed Thanos game type made in conjunction with Marvel for Avengers: Infinity War. Unlike those other game modes, however, Solo Showdown will not change the underlying game in any way — there is no extra shield, the storm doesn’t move any faster, and there are no extra weapon sizes or different team sizes. Instead, Solo Showdown is a way to compete with other Battle Royale players in solo mode to discover who is the true GOAT. Players must compete in 50 matches to join the leaderboard, and placement in each of those first 50 matches will determine overall ranking. Prize pools are as follows: First Place: 50,000 V-Bucks Second Place to Fourth Place: 25,000 V-Bucks Fifth Place to Fiftieth Place: 13,500 V-Bucks Remaining Players in Top 100: 7,500 V-Bucks Up until this point, V-Bucks could only be earned in increments of 100 after purchasing the Battle Pass, which lets players complete challenges and rank up to earn various cosmetic rewards and V-Bucks. Earning V-Bucks, rather than purchasing them with real money, has never netted much of a return. You can only earn enough V-Bucks to purchase maybe one mid-range item per season, or you can save them over the course of multiple seasons to purchase a high-end item. For perspective, the most expensive items on Fortnite Battle Royale often cost around 2,000 V-Bucks, so a player with 50,000 V-Bucks is a rich player indeed. Fortnite Battle Royale has been free to play since its launch, and its virtual currency represents a major revenue stream for Epic Games . While items purchased in the store offer no competitive advantage, they make the game fun and fresh. However, the ability to earn these V-Bucks (in this large of a sum) is a welcome change to the current meta.\n",

Electronic Arts kicked the show off this morning with the first official press conference, and the big news was, as anticipated, Battlefield V. Battlefield V The World War II title will likely get a little more love at the Xbox press conference tomorrow morning, but we did get a look at some compelling gameplay. Notably, the title is getting a Fortnite-style multiplayer, battle royale mode. Anthem Bioware s next title isn t due out until next February, but Anthem still managed to get a lot of love today at E3. The multiplayer shooter finds players assuming the role of mech suit wearing Freelancers. FIFA 19 Due out September 28, EA s big soccer (or football or whatever) title is adding UEFA Champions League gameplay, after picking up the license from Konami. That s big news for European soccer fans, bringing the annual tournament to the title. The company also announced a free trial for Xbox, Playstation and PC players. Madden NFL 19 The popular football title (the other football) is destined for the PC for the first time in more than 10 years. It will bring with it new, more lifelike player animation when it debuts August 10. Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order It wouldn t be an EA E3 event without some Star Wars love. Due out during the 2019 holiday season, the title will offer a dark take on the familiar universe, allowing users to play as a Jedi. That s all we know so far, and sadly, there s no trailer yet to speak of. Unravel 2 No waiting on this one, however. The yarn of a puzzle platformer sequel just dropped today for the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n",

      "The Associated Press is partnering with Arkadium to use InHabit, an interactive content tool launched last year. Arkadium s goal for InHabit is to automatically add interactive polls, quizzes and games into relevant stories, hopefully making those stories more engaging in the process. The technology was initially designed for sports content, so the AP is starting its integration on its pro football, college football and college basketball sites. In fact, the integration is already live, as you can see in this football story. The interactive content what Arkadium calls factives will reach beyond AP-owned properties, because the sites also repurposed and distributed by AP publishers with their own branding. And the company says it s exploring other ways to incorporate factives into the content that it syndicates with partners. Fernando Ferre, the AP s vice president of business development, said he found the partnership appealing because of its scalability, with InHabit allowing the AP to easily integrate this automatically generated content and make it relevant to the article. He also noted that the AP has been experimenting with using artificial intelligence to write earnings reports: We ve carved out an interesting sort of lead position in that area. Arkadium Jessica Rovello said added that team is working with the AP to build templates for the kinds of factives that will fit with AP content. From there, we actually let the system take over, Rovello said. If the system determines that there is a factive that s a good match for this story, it will show up. If there s no match, nothing will show up. The editor doesn t need to be policing this on a day-to-day basis. Featured Image: selimaksan/Getty Images\n",

If you ve been meaning to give it a shot but don t feel like shelling out the $40, this weekend the game is free to play on all platforms (PC, PS4, Xbone) with no restrictions. I guess it s a Valentine s Day promotion. Why not, right? Download Battle.net and register to get started; you can pre-download the game starting tomorrow, with free play beginning midday Friday. It s as good a time to jump in as ever, since the game is constantly evolving as new heroes are added, maps and modes multiply, and Mercy is nerfed, buffed, re-nerfed, and so on. The game can be a little overwhelming at first, but players with similar or non-existent records will be matched with each other so you don t get steamrolled by pros. All the characters play very differently, so you might want to pick someone meaty and straightforward like Soldier 76, Roadhog, or Reaper while you get a handle on things.

      "A PhD candidate in Computer Science at Columbia Engineering, Brian A. Smith, created a new system for blind gamers who want to get a little racing in. The system, called racing auditory display or RAD, is truly amazing. It lets the visually impaired play racing games without “seeing” the screen. Instead, the audio output tells the player when they’re getting closer to an edge and can even enable to them to cut corners in tight turns. “The RAD is the first system to make it possible for people who are blind to play a ‘real’ 3D racing game–with full 3D graphics, realistic vehicle physics, complex racetracks, and a standard PlayStation 4 controller,” said Smith, who worked on the project with Shree Nayar, T.C. Chang Professor of Computer Science. “It’s not a dumbed-down version of a racing game tailored specifically to people who are blind.” The audio changes as players approach turns and tells them where they are on the road. Interestingly, RAD allows blind players to play as well or better than sighted players. The system is universal so game makers can embed the system into upcoming racers. The research paper is available here. “The RAD’s sound slider and turn indicator system work together to help players know the car’s current speed; align the car with the track’s heading; learn the track’s layout; profile the direction, sharpness, timing, and length of upcoming turns; cut corners; choose an early or late apex; position the car for optimal turning paths; and know when to brake to complete a turn,” said Smith. Smith built a racing game in Unity and added RAD to the prototype. He then worked with 15 participants from Helen Keller Services for the Blind and volunteers at Columbia “With the RAD, Edis could not only play our prototype racing game, but do so with the same lap times and driving paths as sighted players,” Smith said. One player, Edis Adilovic, loved the freedom it gave him. “After the training was done, I had the possibility of doing whatever I wanted to,” he said.\n",

      "What could be more perfect than moving the inaugural championship finals for an eSports league from its Los Angeles home to Brooklyn? For Overwatch League, the esports conference created by fiat from Activision Blizzard, the move is the first step in its plans for housing esports teams in cities around the country. Heading from sunny Burbank, Calif. to the hipster heartland of Brooklyn conjures up echoes of the famed Dodger franchise move (in reverse) while tapping into one of the few other markets in the U.S. that might rival LA for esports popularity. When the Overwatch regular season ends on Sunday, June 17, six teams will face off in the league’s first post-season playoffs. Those games are set to begin July 11 and will take place in Burbank at the company’s “Blizzard Arena Los Angeles”. After the playoffs, the final teams will fly to New York to compete for the largest share of a $1.4 million prize pool and the first Overwatch League trophy. The games are slated to begin Friday, July 27 and continue on the 28th. The Overwatch League Grand Finals will be an epic experience for fans and viewers, said Overwatch League commissioner Nate Nanzer in a statement. We want this to be the pinnacle of esports, and holding it at a world-class venue like Barclays Center, in a global capital like New York, will help us celebrate not only the league s two best teams, but the fans, partners, and players who have joined us on this incredible journey. Overwatch is taking a geographic approach to its franchises with teams sponsored by cities in the U.S. and major esports hubs around the world like London, Shanghai, and Seoul. Eventually the league is looking to set up stadiums in locations outside of Burbank. With league play requiring teams to travel — like a traditional sports league. The move to Brooklyn could be a test of how well the Overwatch experience travels and a precursor to the league starting to take its show on the road in earnest. Tickets go on sale on Friday, May 18, at 10 a.m. EDT, and can be bought on ticketmaster.com and barclayscenter.com, while tickets to the first two rounds of the Overwatch League postseason at Blizzard Arena Los Angeles go on sale Thursday, May 10, at 9 a.m. PDT via AXS.com.\n",

      "Over the last year or so daily fantasy sports companies like FanDuel and DraftKings have shifted their focus towards building products that are simple enough for even casual sports fans to play. Today FanDuel is announcing their latest product designed for casual sports fans, called Bracket Pick’em. The game is dead simple – users pick five NCAA teams at the start of the March Madness, and the longer those teams stay in the tournament the more points users get. Of course there is some weighting build in – so you couldn’t just pick five of the top ranked teams. Instead, the combined sum of your five teams has to equal 20 or more, and points will be awarded based on team seed and round, so wins by lower seeds and wins later in the tournament will be worth more points. For example, you could draft four #1 seeds and one #16 seed, or four #3 seeds and one #8 seed team. Any combination of five teams works as long as their combined seeds add up to 20 or more. All games will be free, but FanDuel is giving away $25,000 total in cash prizes to winners. Daily fantasy sports companies have had issues in the past with college games due to strict NCAA rules on using teams’ and player’s names and likeness. This game is the first time FanDuel has released an NCAA-focused game since the platform agreed to suspend all college contests in 2016. The company said there wasn’t any discussion with the NCAA regarding this new game. “We felt [a conversation] was unnecessary as Bracket Pick em is unrelated to our DFS offerings. It s free and focuses on the teams in the tournaments, not drafting a fantasy lineup with NCAA players“, explained FanDuel. Bracket Pick em is the first time FanDuel has released a game that lets users pick teams instead of players. Spending time researching and drafting players is too complex and time consuming for casual fans, and if these companies want to scale they’re going to need to appeal to a much wider range of users with games like these. There’s no arguing that playing fantasy games while watching professional sports improves the fan experience. The key is just figuring out how to build games that appeal to both die hard sports fans and the average person who only tunes into sports for the big games like playoffs and finals games.\n",

The online retailers just announced that starting with UFC 222 on March 3rd, all pay-per-view UFC fights will be available to buy and watch on Amazon prime. Fights can be preordered and also purchased up to four hours after the start time (in case you want to tune in late just for a title fight) and purchasers will also be able to rewind during the event and replay it within a 24-hour window. It s the first time live pay-per-view material is being made available on Amazon Prime Video, and is another reminder that the platform thinks live sports are an important component of an attractive content offering. While UFC s fights are available to buy and stream on their own website, this deal is important because it adds a viewing option where many more potential viewers will likely already have accounts and payment methods on file. No one likes signing up for a service or downloading a new streaming app on their device, so having UFC pay-per-view available for Prime members to easily buy should lead to more viewers and purchases, especially for the more casual fan.

      "Ahead of Mark Zuckerberg’s Senate testimony today, Facebook has rolled out a number of product updates — including a bounty hunting program of up to $40,000 for user data violations — meant to address (and blunt) the criticism he’s likely to face. The bounties start at $500, according to a report by CNBC, and will be awarded if certain conditions are met. First announced amid a slew of updates Zuckerberg offered up in March as the scandal around abuse of user data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica was first coming to light, the new bounty program is modeled off of Facebook’s attempts to combat hackers with a $1 million bounty. It’s the second product announcement today, following news that Facebook would stop apps from accessing user data if they haven’t been launched within 90 days. To be eligible for the bounty, the offending app must impact more than 10,000 Facebook users and show a clear pattern of abuse and not “collection” (in this case, I’m assuming abuse would qualify as transferring the data to a third party without permission). Facebook also stipulated that it should be a case that the company isn’t already actively investigating. Examples of “out of scope” scenarios include: scraping, malware, social engineering applications, and cases involving other Facebook companies (like Instagram). Facebook goes on to assure that if whistleblowers comply with the company’s policy, then the company won’t sue them (which is very big of Facebook). It also tries to ensure that all of the issues are kept quiet and far away from the meddling of the media which could blow the whole thing up and force company executives to testify in front of Congressional hearings. Here are some other details from the program: You give us time to investigate and act on an issue that you report before making any information about the report public or sharing such information with others. You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) unauthorized access to or destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our or another’s services. You provide us with the Facebook data we request after we request it. You do not violate any other applicable laws or regulations, including (but not limited to) laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorized access to data. Again, do not submit any data to us that you obtained unlawfully. Those are the requirements for folks who submit bounties to Facebook. For its part, Facebook agrees to investigate and validate the reports; determine the amount of the bounty; takes responsibility for publishing reports and updates on the bounty; and indicates that one bounty is paid per abuse (if multiple reports of abuse are submitted, it’s first come, first served for payouts). No word yet on whether Facebook will be paying individual journalists or The Guardian or the The New York Times retroactively. So, do news organizations get back pay from this Data Abuse Bounty? https://t.co/VpnFdlglAh — Shira Ovide (@ShiraOvide) April 10, 2018\n",

      "Harbor helps businesses legally issue cryptocurrency tokens that represent ownership of real-world assets like real estate, fine art, company equity, and investment funds. This “tokenization” might sound boring, but it could be a big business that unlocks trading of illiquid property. Harbor‘s intention to become a fundamental bridge between the offline and crypto economies has attracted a $28 million strategic round led by Founders Fund and joined by Andreessen Horowitz, Pantera Capital, and more. Following its $10 million Series A in February, Harbor has now raised over $40 million to dissolve the legal barriers to private securities tokenization. “We think there’s going be a far greater appetite for owning real-world assets using the blockchain” than digital only cryptocurrencies, Harbor CEO Joshua Stein tells me. He expects it be like the impact “email had on snail mail”, but with value instead of content being sent back and forth. Once someone like Harbor handles the technical necessities to make transfers instant, free, and secure, people will exchange a lot more frequently. Here’s how Harbor works. Clients pay it in cash to make their tokenization of an IRL private security legal. Traditional trading of these assets can be complicated and expensive given there are often financial regulations or licensing requirements restricting who can buy and sell them. For example, foreigners or unaccredited investors without enough net worth aren’t allowed to own certain securities. The lawyers to handle these sales can be expensive, and the process can take weeks. Normally, businesses have to be very careful about who they let buy these securities because they’re liable for a 20-year criminal sentence if they violate SEC law. With Harbor, a white list of eligible owners is established by an outside law firm that takes responsibility, and Harbor’s smart contracts refuse to process an illegal sale. Harbor effectively bakes securities law compliance like know-your-customer and anti-fraud/money-laundering into the tokens themselves so trades can happen instantaneously without legal assistance on every sale. Harbor is hoping to launch this Regulated Token (R-Token) system with its first client this summer. The tokens are ERC-20 compatible so they can be sold on lots of cryptocurrency exchanges and stored in popular wallets. Stein stresses that investors will have to trust the underlying securities they’re buying. But they’ll get more trust in who owns something through blockchain transparency rather than some signed contract locked in a desk or vault somewhere. And they won’t have to trust who they’re selling to since the smart contracts only execute the trade if its legal. The idea of making the way hugely valuable assets trade faster, easier, and cheaper led Harbor’s latest round to be oversubscribed. That’s even though it only came out of stealth two months ago from Craft Ventures, the fund and incubator run by PayPal mafioso David Sacks who sold Yammer to Microsoft. Craft Ventures, Vy Capital and Valor Equity Partners joined this that included other new investors like Future Perfect Ventures, 1confirmation, Abstract Ventures, and Signia Venture Partners. Nicolas Berggruen of Berggruen Holdings, Napoleon Ta of Founders Fund, and Kyle Samani and Tushar Jain of Multicoin Capital also put in their personal money. Sacks knew Ta, which set up Founders Fund to lead the round. Meanwhile, Stein says Harbor wanted to team up with Andreessen Horowitz partner and crypto thought leader Chris Dixon. Harbor will have to compete with the other blockchain-for-securities startups like Polymath, which runs entirely decentralized and trustless infrastrucutre to the point that you have to hope strangers want their deposit back enough not to screw you on legal compliance, and tZERO, which is building its own full-stack compliance system. Harbor’s reliance on outside legal firms to build the smart contract white lists makes it more akin to a traditional financial player. Harbor could make a lucrative business out of letting clients sell American securities to the Chinese market, which has shown a strong interest in crypto assets. Stein talks about “a crypto nirvana of a trustless environment” like a true Bitcoin bro. But his new A-list investors show Harbor is no pump-and-dump.\n",

Several members of Congress wrote asking for this in December, and the GAO will look into it in five months or so. A letter from the GAO sent to Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ) dated January 9 and published today reads: Thank you for your letter, jointly signed by a number of your colleagues, requesting that the Government Accountability Office review the extent and pervasiveness of fraud and the misuse of American identities during federal rulemaking processes. GAO accepts your request as work that is within the scope of its authority. There s no guarantee that this will make any waves, but the FCC would almost certainly rather not have these guys poring over their records. If it turns out that the agency did not adequately adhere to the Administrative Procedure Act, which defines how federal rules are to be established, it s possible that the rule could be taken out of effect. Don t get your hopes up, though. That s only one outcome out of many, and it won t happen for months. The GAO letter goes on to say: At the current time we anticipate that staff with the required skills will be available to initiate an engagement in about five months. It stands to reason that using red tape to tie someone up would necessarily involve a bit of a wait. But it does lend legitimacy to the concerns raised by Congress, and of course also by nearly 20 attorneys general. An earlier request, asking that the GAO look into the FCC s rather hand-wavy cyberattack claims, does not, alas, appear to have been answered in the affirmative.

Zuckerberg confirmed that he himself had not been interviewed, then declined to elaborate, citing the confidentiality of the investigation. Senator Leahy asked “I assume Facebook has been served with subpoenas from the special counsel’s office?” Zuckerberg replied “yes.” Leahy then asked if Zuckerberg or anyone at Facebook had been contacted by the special counsel, and Zuckerberg responded “Yes.” When asked if he specifically had been interviewed, the CEO replied “I have not.” Leahy followed up, asking “Others have?” Zuckerberg responded “I believe so.” Zuckerberg then got cagey, explaining that “I want to be careful here because our work with the special counsel is confidential and I want to make sure that in an open session I’m not revealing something that’s confidential.” Leahy asked again to confirm Facebook had been contacted and received subpoenas, to which Zuckerberg responded, “Actually let me clarify. I actually am not aware of a subpoena. I believe that there may be. But I know that we’re working with them.” You can watch this part of the testimony below: Sen.

MZ: I have not. pic.twitter.com/kUKTdlg0Vv — CBS News (@CBSNews) April 10, 2018 Wired reported in January that at least one Facebook staffer had been interviewed by Mueller, and that they were associated with the Trump campaign. Facebook provided assistance to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns in using Facebook’s tools. Now, given information that’s come to light about the Trump campaign working with Cambridge Analytica to optimize its campaigns, and about how Cambridge Analytica obtained that data improperly from a Facebook app built by researcher Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, Mueller’s investigation may have been interested to know if the Facebook staffer was aware of the improperly obtained data. Alternatively, Mueller may have simply been interested in whether the Facebook staffer knew of any Russian connection to the campaign.

      "The UK s data protection bill is facing fresh controversy and the threat of legal action if the government does not ditch an amendment which removes data protection rights in instances where the Home Office deems it could prejudice effective immigration control . Or the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective immigration control . Digital civil rights group the Open Rights Group (ORG) and the3million, a post-Brexit referendum organization advocating for the rights of European Union citizens living in the UK, have said today they are launching formal legal action over the inclusion of the clause. They argue the exemption means at least three million people across the UK would be unable to find out what personal data the Home Office or other related organizations hold on them, with the government able to shield the data behind a claim of effective immigration control risking cementing errors in the processing of applications that could lead to immigrants being unfairly denied entry or deported from the UK. They also argue the clause is incompatible with the incoming EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which the data protection bill is intended to transpose into UK law ahead of the May 25 deadline for applying the regulation. (Although the government is making these specific provisions in a section listing exemptions from GDPR.) 2/ Paragraph 4 of the Data Protection Bill, which is meant to provide greater transparency to people on data held on them, does the exact opposite for immigrants, including the 3m EU citizens.https://t.co/O9U5zafpW5 the3million (@The3Million) March 5, 2018 The Home Office has a reputation for data processing errors and for taking a very heavy-handed approach where immigration is concerned. ORG s executive director, Jim Killock, argues it is trying to use a sweeping exemption to data protection law to cover up its own mistakes. This is an attempt to disguise the Home Office s mistakes by making sure that their errors are never found. When people are wrongly told to leave, they would find it very hard to challenge, he said in a statement. Data protection is a basic safeguard to make sure you can find out what organisations know about you, and why they make decisions. Sometimes, during criminal investigations, that isn t appropriate: but immigrants aren t criminals, nor should they be treated as such. The government has also proposed setting up a new registration system for EU citizens once the UK leaves the EU, as is currently slated to happen in March 2019 meaning there would be a new Home Office database containing the personal details of more than three million people. And where there s data, there s the inevitable risk of errors and inaccuracies. Which is exactly why GDPR has provisions for data subjects to be able to view data held about them and have any errors corrected. An exemption for immigration seems intended to impede such visibility, however. We need safeguards in place to ensure that these citizens have access to the information held about them, so they are able to appeal Home Office decisions or correct mistakes, said Nicolas Hatton, chairman of the3million, in another supporting statement. Everyone should be entitled to know how the Home Office and other government agencies are using their records, and that is why we want this exemption removed. Lawyers from Leigh Day, the firm acting on behalf of ORG and the3million, have written to UK home secretary Amber Rudd outlining their concerns and asking for the clause to be removed from the bill, which gets its second reading debate later today in parliament. Rosa Curling, a human rights solicitor from Leigh Day, said the exemption risks creating a discriminatory two-tier system for data protection rights. The clause is incompatible with GDPR, as well as EU law generally and the European Convention on Human Rights, she said in a statement. If the exemption is made law, our clients will apply for judicial review. They have written to the government today to urge it to reconsider and to remove the immigration exemption from the bill without further delay. We ve contacted the Home Office for comment and will update this story with any response. It s not the first controversy for the 2017 data protection bill. In January concerns were raised, including by the UK s information commissioner, over the implications of a new ethics regime for processing public sector data. Consumer groups have also voiced unhappiness that the government has not taken up another GDPR provision that allows for collective redress for victims of data breaches. On the data retention side, the government is also facing several ongoing legal challenges to its surveillance regime under European law and has lost multiple times including in December 2016 when Europe s top court dealt a major blow to general and indiscriminate data retention directives.\n",

      "Generals are famously always “studying how to fight the last war,” with the last war’s technology, while dismissing how the world and its tech have changed in the interim. This is true for dissidents, rebels, and culture wars too. Our fears tend to be of 20th century boogeymen, the Nazis and the Soviet Union — but we should be worrying about other things entirely. The world and its dystopias have moved on. The Nazis and the Soviets obviously inspired Orwell’s “1984,” which was stunning, visionary, and enormously influential … while still being slightly myopic compared to Huxley’s earlier, much weirder, and much more subversive “Brave New World.” But Orwell too was already able to prophesy a world in which no one really fought for territory any more. What would be the point? Militaries around the world are constructed primarily for national defense against an invading, conquering force, but invading and conquering territory makes no sense any more. Wealth and power are no longer remotely related to how much real estate or raw materials you control. South Korea’s US-dollar GDP is higher than that of Russia. The US swept Iraq’s military away like gauze paper when they invaded in 2003, but it turns out that, even after you overthrow a brutal dictator, even when it’s one of the most oil-rich nations on the planet, attempting to occupy and control a hostile nation inevitably becomes a horribly expensive catastrophe that costs enormously more than any possible benefits. Nation-states don’t invade and conquer each other any more because of military defenses, or any kind of Pax Americana, or because everyone has gotten nicer and kinder over the last hundred years. They don’t do it because, thanks to technology-driven transformations over that time, it simply doesn’t make any sense; in fact it has become complete madness. Similarly, counterculture individualists and lovers of freedom worry about Nazi fascism or Soviet police states. How twentieth century of us. There are plenty of neo-fascists out there, to my dismay, and we often seem to be doing our best to accidentally construct the tools of a police state out of modern technology — smartphones, drones, facial recognition technology, etc. in the much-abused name of “security.” I’m certainly not suggesting that people or societies today are somehow less likely to construct such horrors because they have grown morally better over time. There are plenty of awful people out there. I am, however, suggesting that awful people today are a lot less likely to aim for fascism or totalitarianism because awful people benefit a lot less from those systems than they used to. The Soviet Union collapsed because it was an economic disaster as well as a moral one. The closest things we have to fascist states today — monarchies like North Korea and Saudi Arabia — are fragile, riven by internal contradictions and internecine warfare, facing the future with desperation and fear. There’s a new playbook for oppression today. Instead of outright totalitarian rule, you construct the appearance of democracy, while controlling it by subtly — in some cases perhaps not even consciously — restricting the options available to individual voters; by controlling a tiered system of “representative” electors behind the scenes; or by simply outright stuffing the ballot box. (There can be much sound and fury about the distinctions between the available candidates, but if you’ve done your job correctly, and made democracy as awful as possible, in general only establishment candidates or easily manipulated narcissists will ever be nominated.) Then you give your people enough freedom to thrive; to create, to disrupt, to innovate. And you siphon as much as you can of that created wealth. You don’t give them enough to actually seriously challenge the establishment, of course; to, say, remake the system so that the siphoned wealth goes to its poor and oppressed people instead of its silent, invisible masters. That is a red line that must not be crossed. But the beauties of this system — call it parasitism — is that it is very rare to encounter a challenger who cannot be co-opted. It vampire-squids enough wealth for its upper-tier members and their families to live lives of extraordinary, gilded luxury, without the unpleasant threat of being assassinated or deposed that comes with outright fascism or totalitarianism. These parasitic systems couldn’t exist without today’s technology. They are mostly networked, not hierarchical. They watch, they adapts, and they distract. They construct shell corporations that shuttle gobs of money around the globe like 747s. And they very rarely needs to resort to violence, because, like the Borg, and like capitalism itself — from which it is distinct, although there are places where it has been so successful that people rarely recognize any difference — parasitism usually has the capacity to absorb all those who confront it. I’m not saying fascism and totalitarianism are things we should be completely unworried about. They’re out there, they’re real, and they’re terrifying. But there are playbooks for how to fight them. Parasitism, though, seems almost unstoppable. Presumably the solution is a technological one; let’s hope it’s discovered soon.\n",

      "Visitors to Backpage.com today were greeted by a simple message from the U.S. Department of Justice, noting that it had seized the classifieds site. According to the static image, the move was a joint effort that included the FBI, IRS and the U.S Postal Inspection Service. The action, while brash, perhaps wasn t unexpected. The site has come under scrutiny from authorities in recent years for its adult ads, which helped make it the second largest classifieds site behind Craigslist. After pushback against specific ads promoting illegal activity, the site has been insistent that it simply hosts third-party content, removing offending ads when brought to its attention. A Washington Post story from last year, however, noted that, A contractor for the controversial classifieds website Backpage.com has been aggressively soliciting and creating sex-related ads, despite Backpage s repeated insistence that it had no role in the content of ads posted on its site. Along with the site seizure, FBI officials raided the Arizona home of founder Michael Lacey. According to a local news station, the move included the indictment of seven people on 93 counts, including some related to money laundering and facilitating prostitution. Back in 2016, officials raided the site s Dallas headquarters, arresting CEO Carl Ferrer in the process. At the time, warrants were also issued for Lacey and co-founder James Larkin. The move comes in the wake of the Senate and House passing the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA). The act is still awaiting the president s signature, but the impending bill was enough to drive Craigslist to shutter its own personal ads section late last month, while coming under fire from internet activists and sex workers alike for the onus it put on sites hosting listings. We’ve reached out to the DOJ for additional comment.\n",

      "It’s scooters all the way down this morning, with Lime also reportedly raising $250 million in a funding this morning after a new Delaware filing this morning indicated that competitor Bird authorized the sale of up to $200 million in shares. GV (formerly Google Ventures) is leading this round, according to the report by Axios, as the massive land grab for a stake in the scooter wars continues to heat up whether that’s funding or actual scooters piling up on the sidewalk. Both companies have faced pushback from some city regulators (probably on the basis of tripping over them and falling on your face), but it still means the venture community is still salivating over potentially the next major mode of metropolitan transportation. Most venture investors in the Valley argue scooters make sense for short trips throughout areas that are just too far to be considered a trek, but too close that it would be a waste of time and money to call a ride share like Uber or Lyft. Given that Uber exposed a massive hole for easier transportation in major metropolitan areas and potentially replacing cars in those areas getting into the next big transportation revolution is more than tempting enough for firms like GV (which is also an investor in Uber). Lime was previously reported to be seeking up to $500 million in funding and was taking meetings with some major firms in Silicon Valley over the past few weeks. It might not get that, but a $250 million influx might be plenty to try to continue to ramp up its business and get more rides on board. Axios is reporting that Lime has told investors users have taken 4.2 million rides and each scooter gets 8 to 12 rides per day. Still, while it’s not $500 million, there’s plenty of interest in the on-demand scooter business challenges of keeping them charged and intact included that Bird has authorized the sale of up to $200 million in new shares at a $1 billion valuation just months after its previous round. So it might not be surprising if this, too, ends up as kind of a rolling process where Lime eventually gets all the capital it sought.\n",

      "Earlier today, news broke of a fatal crash involving one of Uber’s self-driving cars in Tempe, Arizona. In response, Uber halted its self-driving car programs where it currently operates, including in Pittsburgh, Toronto, San Francisco and Phoenix. The U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell and others have since released statements about the crash. In a statement to TechCrunch, the NHTSA said it has sent over its “Special Crash Investigation” team to Temple. This is “consistent with NHTSA’s vigilant oversight and authority over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment, including automated technologies,” a spokesperson for the agency told TechCrunch. “NHTSA is also in contact with Uber, Volvo, Federal, State and local authorities regarding the incident,” the spokesperson said. “The agency will review the information and proceed as warranted.” Over in Tempe, Mitchell called the accident “tragic,” saying the city grieves for Elaine Herzberg, the woman who lost her life. “The City of Tempe has been supportive of autonomous vehicle testing because of the innovation and promise the technology may offer in many areas, including transportation options for disabled residents and seniors,” Mayor Mitchell said in a statement. “All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here.” Here is my statement regarding the tragic event that occurred in Tempe overnight. pic.twitter.com/3ql1WAxKpA — Mayor Mark Mitchell (@AZMayorMitchell) March 19, 2018 Moving forward, the city of Tempe and its police department will look into the accident to try to figure out what happened, Mitchell said. In the meantime, Mitchell said he supports the step Uber has taken to temporarily suspend its self-driving tests. Over in California, where Uber has also suspended its self-driving car tests, the DMV says it “takes the safe operation of our autonomous vehicle permit holders very seriously,” a DMV spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. “The California DMV has many requirements in place for testing permit holders and requires collision reports and annual disengagement reports,” the spokesperson said. “We are aware of the Uber crash in Arizona, but we have not been briefed on the details of the crash at this time. We plan to follow up with Uber to get more information.” Assemblymember Jim Frazier (D-Discovery Bay), who is also chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, also chimed in, saying his “heart goes out to the family of the victim.” He added, Unlike Arizona, California has taken a safety driven approach when developing autonomous vehicle regulations. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to save thousands of lives a year, but they have to be tested properly to protect the public. My Committee plans on having a hearing in May that will focus on the safety of these vehicles. Earlier today, the National Safety Transportation Board announced it would conduct its own field investigation. That came after Uber’s statement, in which the company expressed its condolences and said the company is working with local authorities in their investigation.

      "The latest entry in Huawei s on-going struggles to come to the U.S. proved to be one of the more unexpected and engaging CES storylines last week. But there are still plenty of layers of this onion left to peel back. This morning, Reuters is confirming speculation that AT&T s last minute decision to pull out of a deal with the Chinese phone maker comes as U.S. lawmakers applied pressure on the carrier. According to the outlet s sources, AT&T s hand was forced when members of Congress lobbied against its plan to offer Huawei handsets through its carrier subsidy program. Lawmakers are reportedly going even further, pushing the country s second largest carrier to cut more ties with the company. On the docket are a plan to hash out 5G network standards and a deal with Cricket, a prepaid wireless provider that was absorbed into AT&T back in 2013. The aforementioned lawmakers have also reportedly warned that ties to Huawei and state-owned telecom company China Mobile could jeopardize potential contracts with the government. The report is certainly in line with a 2012 House Intelligence Committee report, which flagged both Huawei and ZTE as potential security risks, stating, Private-sector entities in the United States are strongly encouraged to consider the long-term security risks associated with doing business with either ZTE or Huawei for equipment or service. On Friday, Texas Republican Michael Conaway introduced a bill seeking to prohibit the U.S. government from working with any carriers using either Huawei or ZTE handsets. That arrived a few days after Richard Yu seemingly went off script at a CES keynote to excoriate U.S. carriers for refusing to work with Huawei, stating, it s a big loss for consumers, because they don t have the best choice for devices. Huawei clearly had big plans for a U.S. push this year, including a huge ad campaign featuring Wonder Woman actress, Gal Gadot. Without the support of a carrier, such an aggressive push will be something of a nonstarter in a country where most phone purchases are still made through service providers.\n",

      "Ahead of 2018 U.S. midterm elections, Twitter is taking a visible step to combat the spread of misinformation on its famously chaotic platform. In a blog post this week, the company explained how it would be adding “election labels” to the profiles of candidates running for political office. “Twitter has become the first place voters go to seek accurate information, resources, and breaking news from journalists, political candidates, and elected officials,” the company wrote in its announcement. “We understand the significance of this responsibility and our teams are building new ways for people who use Twitter to identify original sources and authentic information.” These labels feature a small government building icon and text identifying the position a candidate is running for and the state or district where the race is taking place. The label information included in the profile will also appear elsewhere on Twitter, even when tweets are embedded off-site. The labels will start popping up after May 30 and will apply to candidates in state governor races as well as those campaigning for a seat in the Senate or the House of Representatives. Twitter will partner with nonpartisan political nonprofit Ballotpedia to create the candidate labels. In a statement announcing its partnership, Ballotpedia explains how that process will work: Ballotpedia covers all candidates in every upcoming election occurring within the 100 most-populated cities in the U.S., plus all federal and statewide elections, including ballot measures. After each state primary, Ballotpedia will provide Twitter with information on gubernatorial and Congressional candidates who will appear on the November ballot. After receiving consent from each candidate, Twitter will apply the labels to each candidate profile. The decision to create a dedicated process to verify political profiles is a step in the right direction for Twitter. With major social platforms still in upheaval over revelations around foreign misinformation campaigns during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter and Facebook need to take decisive action now if they intend to inoculate their users against a repeat threat in 2018.\n",

      "The Office of the Inspector General has issued its report on the circumstances surrounding the FBI’s 2016 lawsuit attempting to force Apple to unlock an iPhone as part of a criminal investigation. While it stops short of saying the FBI was untruthful in its justification of going to court, the report is unsparing of the bureaucracy and clashing political motives that ultimately undermined that justification. The official narrative, briefly summarized, is that the FBI wanted to get into a locked iPhone allegedly used in the San Bernardino bombing in late 2015. Then-director Comey explained on February 9 that the Bureau did not have the capability to unlock the phone, and that as Apple was refusing to help voluntarily, a lawsuit would be filed compelling it to assist. But then, a month later, a miracle occurred: a third party had come forward with a working method to unlock the phone and the lawsuit would not be necessary after all. Though this mooted the court proceedings, which were dropped, it only delayed the inevitable and escalating battle between tech and law enforcement specifically the “going dark” problem of pervasive encryption. Privacy advocates saw the suit as a transparent (but abortive) attempt to set a precedent greatly expanding the extent to which tech companies would be required to help law enforcement. Apple of course fought tooth and nail. In 2016 the OIG was contacted by Amy Hess, a former FBI Executive Assistant Director, who basically said that the process wasn’t nearly so clean as the Bureau made it out to be. In the course of its inquiries the Inspector General did find that to be the case, though although the FBI’s claims were not technically inaccurate or misleading, they also proved simply to be incorrect and it is implied that they may have been allowed to be incorrect in order to further the “going dark” narrative. The full report is quite readable (if you can mentally juggle the numerous acronyms) but the findings are essentially as follows. Although Comey stated on February 9 that the FBI did not have the capability to unlock the phone and would seek legal remedy, the inquiry found that the Bureau had not exhausted all the avenues available to it, including some rather obvious ones. For instance, one senior engineer was tasked with asking trusted vendors if they had anything that could help two days after Comey already said the FBI had no options left. Not only that, but there was official friction over whether classified tools generally reserved for national security purposes should be considered for this lesser, though obviously serious, criminal case. In the first case, it turned out that yes, a vendor did have a solution “90 percent” done, and was happy to finish it up over the next month. How could the director have said that the FBI didn’t have the resources to do this, when it had not even asked its usual outside sources for help? In the second, it’s still unclear whether there in fact exist classified tools that could have been brought to bear on the device in question. Testimony is conflicting on this point, with some officials saying that there was a “line in the sand” drawn between classified and unclassified tools, and another saying it was just a matter of preference. Regardless, those involved were less than forthcoming even within the Bureau, and even internal leadership was left wondering if there were solutions they hadn’t considered. Hess, who brought the initial complaint to the OIG, was primarily concerned not that there was confusion in the ranks it’s a huge organization and communication can be difficult but that the search for a solution was deliberately allowed to fail in order that the case could act as a precedent advantageous to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Comey was known to be very concerned with the “going dark” issue and would likely have pursued such a case with vigor. So the court case, Hess implied, was the real goal, and the meetings early in 2016 were formalities, nothing more than a paper trail to back up Comey’s statements. When a solution was actually found, because an engineer had taken initiative to ask around, officials hoping for a win in court were dismayed: She became concerned that the CEAU Chief did not seem to want to find a technical solution, and that perhaps he knew of a solution but remained silent in order to pursue his own agenda of obtaining a favorable court ruling against Apple. According to EAD Hess, the problem with the Farook iPhone encryption was the poster child case for the Going Dark challenge. The CEAU Chief told the OIG that, after the outside vendor came forward, he became frustrated that the case against Apple could no longer go forward, and he vented his frustration to the ROU Chief. He acknowledged that during this conversation between the two, he expressed disappointment that the ROU Chief had engaged an outside vendor to assist with the Farook iPhone, asking the ROU Chief, Why did you do that for? While this doesn’t really imply a pattern of deception, it does suggest a willingness and ability on the part of FBI leadership to manipulate the situation to its advantage. A judge saying the likes of Apple must do everything possible to unlock an iPhone, and all forward ramifications of that, would be a tremendous coup for the Bureau and a major blow to user privacy. The OIG ultimately recommends that the FBI “improve communication and coordination” so that this type of thing doesn’t happen (and it is reportedly doing so). Ironically, if the FBI had communicated to itself a bit better, the court case likely would have continued under pretenses that only its own leadership would know were false.\n",

      "Could this be just the beginning of a much bigger Cambridge Analytica scandal for Facebook? The answer rides on how transparent Facebook is actually being right now. CEO Mark Zuckerberg just put forth a statement and plan to improve data privacy, but omitted some of the most greivous inquiries, and stopped short of apologizing. Exactly how Facebook handled the multi-year fiasco could be core to whether the public forgets and goes back to scrolling their News Feed, or whether users leave en masse while government regulators swoop in. With journalists around the world digging in and government officials calling for Zuckerberg to testify, the truth is likely to trickle out. Here’s what we want to know: To what exent did Facebook vigorously investigate whether Cambridge Analytica had actually deleted all its Facebook user data back in 2015 when it made it promise to do so, and why didn’t it inform the public of the situation? (When did Zuckerberg find out? Was Facebook concerned about appearing liberal and for investigating a conservative political organization?) How could Facebook not know Cambridge Analytica was using ill-gotten Facebook data when Facebook employees worked directly with the Donald Trump campaign? (Facebook employees worked side-by-side with Cambridge Analytica in Trump’s San Antonio campaign office, so did they look the other way about suspicious data?) Did Cambridge Analytica attain illicit Facebook data from any other sources besides Alexander Koger’s app, such as from other apps it operated, scraping Facebook group membership, or buying data from other developers? (Was the Trump campaign’s masterful use of Facebook and other social media powered by more than just this one data set, perhaps even from other social networks?) Is there any evidence that data from Russian hackers or the governemnt was used by Cambridge Analytica to inform Trump’s campaign marketing? (If so, could Facebook be the smoking gun of potential collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign?) Is Facebook retaining data, ads, or posts connected to Cambridge Analytica for further investigation? (If Cambridge Analytica did misuse data, what content was powered by that misuse, and who else pitched in?) Why did Facebook try to suppress the stories about Cambridge Analytica from news outlets like The Observer with legal threats if it’s so serious about atoning for the scandal? (Who authorized or conducted those threats, and what’s happened to them since?) How will Facebook ensure the security of user data attained by apps given that there could be tons of developers storing multiple separate copies of the data, beyond the big or suspicious ones Facebook plans to audit?

      "Hawaiian residents were briefly but intensely disturbed this morning by a state-wide alert via TV and phone warning of an incoming ballistic missile. It was, however, shortly afterwards confirmed to be a mistake caused by human error. Hawaiian Senator Brian Schatz called the false alarm inexcusable and said to expect tough and quick accountability and a fixed process. The alert went out at a little after 8 AM Hawaiian time, appearing on phones as an emergency services popup and broadcast on TV as a detailed warning of how to seek shelter. This is not a drill, it concluded. Authorities quickly issued followups to calm the no doubt panicking populace, but I imagine it s hard to do that properly when you ve just told everyone in the state to seek shelter and lie on the floor. NO missile threat to Hawaii. Hawaii EMA (@Hawaii_EMA) January 13, 2018 Given the current state of international relations, particularly with North Korea, it s hard to imagine how a simple human error could have resulted in such a major alert. In a statement issued a few hours later, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency explained in a bit more detail what happened: Approx. 8:05 a.m. A routine internal test during a shift change was initiated. This was a test that involved the Emergency Alert System, the Wireless Emergency Alert, but no warning sirens. 8:07 a.m. A warning test was triggered statewide by the State Warning Point, HI-EMA. The local military representative checked with USPACOM that no launch had actually happened by 8:10, and at 8:13 the alert was cancelled. Social media and other online explanations appeared starting a few minutes after that, and official messages saying There is no missile threat to Hawaii were spread via the broadcast system at 8:45 So what exactly happened? It still isn t completely clear, but it sounds like a test of the system that was meant to stay internal ended up getting out. In order to prevent this from happening again, HI-EMA is taking three measures, as explained in the statement: On the recommendations of the HI-EMA Administrator, Vern Miyagi, the Governor has suspended all future drills until HI-EMA has completed a full analysis of the event. HI-EMA has already instituted a two-person activation/verification rule for tests as well as actual missile launch notifications. A cancellation command that can be done automatically that can be triggered within seconds of an error, has been put in place. This of course makes it clear that a single person could activate the tests and real warnings, which seems risky, and that once initiated it was not easy to cancel them (perhaps by design). Put these together and there s certainly a large risk of mistake or misuse. HI-EMA is also evaluating the possibility of expanding notification processes for officials for situations like this. A full report will be made next week. In the mean time it may be wise for other states to check whether their systems are similarly at risk for a false alarm.\n",

      "As the House advances a 2,232-page spending bill meant to avert a government shutdown, privacy advocates and big tech companies aren’t seeing eye to eye about a small piece of legislation tucked away on page 2,212. The Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, a.k.a. the CLOUD Act (H.R.4943, S.2383) aims to simplify the way that international law enforcement groups obtain personal data stored by U.S.-based tech platforms — but the changes to that process are controversial. As it stands, if a foreign government wants to obtain that data in the course of an investigation, a series of steps are necessary. First, that government must have a Mutual Legal Assistant Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S. government in place, and those treaties are ratified by the Senate. Then it can send a request to the U.S. Department of Justice, but first the DOJ needs to seek approval from a judge. After those requirements are met, the request can move along to the tech company hosting the data that the foreign government is seeking. The debate around the CLOUD Act also taps into tech company concerns that foreign nations may move to pass laws in favor of data localization, or the process of storing users’ personal data within the borders of the country of which they are a citizen. That trend would prove both costly for cloud data giants and difficult, upending the established model of cloud data storage that optimizes for efficiency rather than carefully sorting out what data is stored within the borders of which country. In a February 6 letter, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook and Oath (TechCrunch’s parent company) co-authored a letter calling the CLOUD Act “notable progress to protect consumers’ rights.” In a late February blog post, Microsoft Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith addressed the issue. “The CLOUD Act creates both the incentive and the framework for governments to sit down and negotiate modern bi-lateral agreements that will define how law enforcement agencies can access data across borders to investigate crimes,” Smith wrote. “It ensures these agreements have appropriate protections for privacy and human rights and gives the technology companies that host customer data new statutory rights to stand up for the privacy rights of their customers around the world.” Today is an important day for privacy rights around the world, for international relations, and for building trust in the technology we all rely on every day. pic.twitter.com/9afiFXmzGn — Brad Smith (@BradSmi) March 22, 2018 In a recent opinion piece, ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani argues that the CLOUD Act sidesteps oversight from both the legislative and judicial branches, granting the attorney general and the state department too much discretion in choosing which governments the U.S. will enter into a data exchange agreement with. The Center for Democracy and Technology also opposes the CLOUD Act on the grounds that it fails to protect the digital privacy of American citizens and the Electronic Frontier Foundation dismissed the legislation as “a new backdoor around the Fourth Amendment.” The Open Technology Institute also denounced the CLOUD Act’s provision to “allow qualifying foreign governments to enter into an executive agreement to bypass the human rights protective Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process when seeking data in criminal investigations and to seek data directly from U.S. technology companies.” Both organizations acknowledge that improvements to the bill do partially address some of the human rights concerns associated with not requiring an MLAT in a data sharing agreement. “While this version of the CLOUD Act includes some new safeguards, it is still woefully inadequate to protect individual rights,” OTI Director of Surveillance & Cybersecurity Policy Sharon Bradford Franklin said of the changes. “Critically, the bill still would permit foreign governments to obtain communications data held in the United States without any prior judicial review, and it would allow foreign governments to obtain U.S.-held communications in real time without applying the safeguards required for wiretapping by the U.S. government. ” The Consumer Technology Association voiced its support of the altered bill in a press release issued Thursday. “CTA thanks the House of Representatives for taking steps to empower America’s digital infrastructure for the 21st century. The inclusion of the CLOUD Act and RAY BAUM’S Act in today’s legislation ensures Americans can safely create, share and collect electronic data while providing them the resources to do so.” While some changes made aspects of the bill more palatable to digital privacy watchdogs, some are objecting to the choice to tack it onto the omnibus spending bill. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul spoke out Thursday against passing the CLOUD Act by attaching it to the spending bill. “Tucked away in the omnibus spending bill is a provision that allows Trump, and any future president, to share Americans’ private emails and other information with countries he personally likes. That means he can strike deals with Russia or Turkey with nearly zero congressional involvement and no oversight by U.S. courts,” Wyden said. This bill contains only toothless provisions on human rights that Trump s cronies can meet by merely checking a box. It is legislative malpractice that Congress, without a minute of Senate debate, is rushing through the CLOUD Act on this must-pass spending bill.” But guess what? Congress can t vote to reject the CLOUD Act, because it just got stuck onto the Omnibus, with no prior legislative action or review. https://t.co/8b6W08goXm — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 22, 2018 While the content of the CLOUD Act has evolved away from controversy with some modifications, the choice to pass it as part of the omnibus plan without further opportunity for public debate to examine its potential far-reaching implications is proving just as controversial as earlier forms of the legislation.\n",

      "Concerns have been raised about a set of late stage government amendments inserted into the UK s draft data protection bill. The clauses deal with the processing of public sector data. Health data privacy advocacy group MedConfidential believes ministers are trying to sneak in a data protection law carveout, in order to hand politicians the power to judge the ethics of for example applying AI to taxpayer funded medical data-sets. Thus far, the Data Protection Bill 2017, which is intended to align domestic rules with the incoming EU General Data Protection Regulation and generally gives consumers more control over how their data is used has attracted limited controversy. Although some privacy groups argue the government is not going far enough on data redress powers. But if complex and impactful ethical judgments about how to process sensitive public sector data are to be nakedly conjoined to political interests that would indeed be a major cause for alarm. MedConfidential s view is that the government is seeking to legislate in haste, eschewing a proper public debate about the appropriate shape that data processing and AI activity should take in the public sector at a time when rising use of automation and machine learning technologies in the commercial sphere is highlighting myriad ethical issues and challenges flowing from algorithmic decision-making. Ministers say they want a world leading data protection regime they just don t want to be bound by any of the protections they claim to offer citizens, argues MedConfidential s Sam Smith. The next time someone in government loses your sensitive data, it will be a politician who gets to decide if the rules were even broken. Nor is Smith s the only disquieted voice here. The UK s data protection commissioner has its own set of concerns about the scope and intent of ministers late stage proposals for public sector data processing. On this, an ICO spokesperson told us: We have set out our concerns on these provisions with the government, especially around the ICO having to take account of Secretary of State guidance. We believe this provision is not required as we always take other statutory guidance into account when exercising our powers. Framework for Data Processing by Government Clauses 175-178 of the current amended draft bill introduce a Framework for Data Processing by Government ostensibly, according to a spokesman for the Department for Media, Culture and Sport, to allow the government to set out how it processes data in the interest of transparency and trust . No greater degree of transparency was forthcoming when we asked why DCMS believes it s necessary to augment an already 250+ page data protection bill with a framework for public sector data at this late stage. An amendment which at least as currently worded appears to give politicians an arbitrating role over data ethics by specifying only a duty to consult the UK s data protection watchdog. Here s the current wording: (1) The Secretary of State may prepare a document, called the Framework for Data Processing by Government, which contains guidance about the processing of personal data in connection with the exercise of functions of (a) the Crown, a Minister of the Crown or a United Kingdom government department, and (b) a person with functions of a public nature who is specified or described in regulations made by the Secretary of State. (5) Before preparing a document or amendments under this section, the Secretary of State must consult (a) the Commissioner, and (b) any other person the Secretary of State considers it appropriate to consult. The scope of public sector data is of course very wide indeed covering everything from medical records held by the UK s National Health Service to employment, welfare and other highly sensitive data held by the Department for Work and Pensions, to asylum and immigration data on file at the Home Office, to name just a few examples. Add to that, if data can more easily be pooled and processed in concert across public sector silos something the government has said it wants to do there are even greater ethical considerations and privacy risks in play. Throw in the omnipresent pressures of Brexit to cut costs and engineer all sorts of complex feats within ludicrously tiny timescales, such as conjuring an automagical technology-powered non-hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (as has been suggested as one possible solution for that particular Brexit conundrum) and it s not hard to see why ministers might be in an unseemly haste to feed public sector data-sets to any technologist who claims they can engineer a solution. Clause 176, which deals with the approval process for public sector data processing framework documents, requires DCMS Secretary of State to obtain parliamentary approval before issuing a document with a period of 40 days afforded for this scrutiny process. Approved documents must then be issued and come into force within 21 days. The DCMS spokesman did not respond explicitly when we asked whether the ICO will have full oversight powers over the framework (i.e. rather than just playing a consultant role) saying only that: The Secretary of State would give proper regard to all comments made by the Information Commissioner in consultation on the framework. But does proper regard equate to full regulatory oversight ? At this stage it s not entirely clear. What is clear is that the ICO is concerned that it does not. The DCMS spokesman also pointed out that the bill is still going through parliamentary, adding that any amendments will be debated through this process . The Government consulted the Information Commissioner in the preparation of clauses 175 and 178 and will continue to work the ICO when preparing its guidance and ensure that there is no conflict with the ICO s statutory codes, he added. While the ICO told us it continues to have regular discussions with the government regarding the bill and will be providing views as part of the Parliamentary process . So it s possible and to be hoped that greater clarity will emerge vis-a-vis the government s intentions before another substantial piece of data-related legislation gets cemented into UK law. (One example of current muddiness: The term data processing , which could imply all sorts of ways of manipulating data; a point that the information commissioner herself raises, noting: The definition of this is very wide and could cover any aspect of data handling within government or other bodies to whom the measure is applied. ) Call for greater clarity According to the ICO s most recent assessment of the bill, this set of amendments was introduced by DCMS to provide government departments with a clearer legal basis for their processing activities, especially around data sharing . The Commissioner understands the need for government departments and public bodies to be clear about their legal basis for undertaking their functions and this is particularly true when processing personal data, it begins, before going on to flesh out a number of concerns such as warning that the provisions as drafted appear to go beyond this limited ambition and create different risks ; and raising specific worries that the current phrasing of clause 175(1)(b) could also extent to include private sector bodies providing data processing services to the public sector. This wording does not appear constrained to just public bodies who may have concerns about their legal basis, but to others who may be able to act privately but nevertheless undertake some limited functions of a public nature, it writes, adding: These provisions should just address those public bodies where there is a need for greater clarity on their legal basis for processing. This regulation-making power seems unnecessarily wide to achieve the government s objective of addressing data processing primarily within government departments and there should be a clearer, more focussed provision setting out the other bodies to which the requirement may be applied, it further adds. One recent example of a private sector tech company becoming embroiled in a UK public sector data ethics scandal culminated, last summer, with the ICO sanctioning a London NHS Trust that had signed an information sharing arrangement with Google DeepMind after the watchdog judged the pair s 2015 data-sharing arrangement to have breached domestic privacy law. In that instance 1.6 million patients fully identifiable medical records were shared with the Google-owned company without people s knowledge or consent. Even now it s still not clear what legal basis is being claimed for the data to be being passed. Having its name attached to a regulatory sanction hasn t prevented Google DeepMind signing additional data-sharing arrangements with other UK NHS Trusts to continue rolling out the clinical task management app that makes use of the data. It also has other research partnerships with NHS Trusts that involve AI research on NHS patients health data. So the commercial demand for gaining access to large-scale public sector data-sets is clear. At the same time the UK government has made it clear that supporting AI-based innovation is a strategic priority. It commissioned an independent review into ways to grow the UK s AI industry, which was published this October urging increasing ease of access to data in a wider range of sectors . This summer another government-commissioned industrial strategy review, of the life sciences sector, also flagged up the value locked up in publicly funded data-sets as an opportunity though its author warned against giving valuable public sector health data away for free to commercial entities, and called for a new regulatory framework to capture for the UK the value in algorithms generated using NHS data . On the healthcare front, it could be argued that a Conservative policy of shrinking funding to the NHS, which puts pressure on the service to do more with less, is intended to open Trusts doors to AI innovators when they come knocking and touting their ability to build cost-cutting tools if only they re given access to the data. (In the case of Google-DeepMind, it is not charging Trusts for five years of co-development work in exchange for access to patients healthcare data.) But in the face of these conjoined commercial and political imperatives, what s to stop data ethics getting squeezed in the middle? A Minister s job is to be political it is therefore unclear why anyone should expect a unit headed by a Minister to make ethical decisions, argues Smith. There are many things that are entirely lawful, but whether they are ethical is the subject of infinite debate. Ethics being politicized? The government has published (in 2016) a 17-page ethical framework for the use of data science in the public sector a document that s currently being updated. It has also proposed setting up a quango for data ethics and innovation whose appointed advisors would be reporting to ministers making data processing decisions. But MedConfidential s concern is exactly that: If public sector data processing is going to be given a new statutory basis via the incoming DP bill that takes it outside the normal data protection rules then the ethics of doing things like applying AI to the most highly intimate forms of citizen data will be in the hands of ministers, rather than left to dedicated data guardians to judge. Designed for the worthy goal of incentivizing innovation within and between government departments, it is an example of the worst kind of misuse of data ethics namely, as a tool to introduce subjectivity and negotiability into governmental compliance with the law, societal expectations, and public accountability, says Julia Powles, research fellow at Cornell Tech, giving her assessment of the proposed framework for public sector data processing. There is real import to ethics this is not it, she adds. Smith also points out that DCMS is hardly a government department with a strong history of data processing. Yet it s the DCMS Secretary of State who would be in charge of these public sector data processing frameworks with the ICO seemingly relegated to playing second fiddle. For its part the ICO says its most significant concerns relate to Clause 178(5) which states: In determining a question arising in connection with the carrying out of any of the Commissioner s functions, the Commissioner must take into account a provision of a document issued under section 176(3) if (a) the question relates to a time when the provision was in force, and (b) the provision appears to the Commissioner to be relevant to the question. This puts a duty on the Commissioner to take the Secretary of State s framework guidance into account when considering any question relevant to her functions, it writes. Whilst [the Commissioner] understands the relevance of considering any guidance about the legal basis of government functions the provision runs a real risk of creating the impression that the Commissioner will not enjoy the full independence of action and freedom from external influence when deciding how to exercise her full range of functions as required by Article 52 of the GDPR. The European Union s incoming General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May, and is intended to strengthen the standing and powers of EU Member State DPAs like the ICO. Yet here the UK s data watchdog is warning that the government might be at risk of breaching the incoming data protection rules by legislating to undermine her independence. And while it s true that the UK is in the process of negotiating its exit from the EU, as a result of the 2016 Brexit vote, Hancock has previously stated it s the government s intention to closely mirror EU data protection standards because for economic reasons it really needs to avoid a cliff-edge cut-off for digital data flows between the EU and UK. So the ICO s warning should carry some weight. Or else, suggests Paul Bernal, senior lecturer in law at the University of East Anglia, the government may be calculating that, in a post-Brexit future, it might be able to carve out a little data protection divergence for the UK without risking the sought for EU adequacy arrangement on data protection standards. This may be primarily for the post-Brexit scenario, when more divergence may be possible whilst still getting adequacy, he suggests. Though that could ultimately prove a costly miscalculation, as the EU s top court will remain the arbiter of whether the UK is achieving adequate data protection or not. It will not be for UK ministers to make such judgement calls. An adequacy decision will be made by the Commission, and can be struck down by the European Court of Justice whatever our own position is, Bernal notes. It s effectively an internal EU decision concerning the UK, not a joint decision. Just as the ECJ struck down the Safe Harbour with the U.S .. the U.S. aren t under the ECJ, but it doesn t matter. So, as ever when it comes to data and the law, the devil is in the detail. And time will tell whether concerns over the government s intentions regarding data ethics and data access will dissolve or grow horns. Featured Image: maciek905/Getty Images\n",

      "The Trump administration appears to be creating distance between itself and rumors that it might end the practice of extending H-1B visas during the green card application process. The rumored change would have a large impact on foreign tech workers in the U.S., but the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is offering assurances that no such policy change is underway. In a statement to TechCrunch, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Chief of Media Relations Jonathan Withington noted that the agency is examining other potential policy changes in light of the Buy American, Hire American executive order, which the president signed last April. That includes a thorough review of employment based visa programs, though USCIS explained that the H1-B extension policy was not on the chopping block. USCIS clarified its stance in a statement to TechCrunch: We are not at liberty to discuss any part of the pre-decisional processes; however, all proposed rules publish in the federal register and USCIS posts all policy memoranda on our website What we can say, however, is that USCIS is not considering a regulatory change that would force H-1B visa holders to leave the United States by changing our interpretation of section 104(c) of AC-21, which provides for H-1B extensions beyond the 6 year limit. Even if it were, such a change would not likely result in these H-1B visa holders having to leave the United States because employers could request extensions in one-year increments under section 106(a)-(b) of AC21 instead. McClatchy reports that this reassurance comes after the business community sharply rebuked the potential policy change, though USCIS denies that claim. Featured Image: Epoxydude/Getty Images\n",

      "According to a new report, the same group that hacked the Democratic National Committee actively targeted the U.S. Senate through the latter half of 2017. The revelation comes out of a new report from Trend Micro, a Japanese firm that has revealed similar phishing schemes taking aim at foreign governments in the past. As the security report details, the activity began in June 2017 and attempted to compromise a lawmaker s credentials through a phishing site designed to look like the Senate s internal email system. Trend Micro s report focuses on the efforts of a hacking group it calls Pawn Storm, an extremely active espionage actor group more commonly known as Fancy Bear. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has deemed the group a Russian-based threat actor with likely ties to Russian military intelligence. Trend Micro describes the nature of the attacks: Beginning in June 2017, phishing sites were set up mimicking the ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services) of the U.S. Senate. By looking at the digital fingerprints of these phishing sites and comparing them with a large data set that spans almost five years, we can uniquely relate them to a couple of Pawn Storm incidents in 2016 and 2017. The real ADFS server of the U.S. Senate is not reachable on the open internet, however phishing of users credentials on an ADFS server that is behind a firewall still makes sense. In case an actor already has a foothold in an organization after compromising one user account, credential phishing could help him get closer to high profile users of interest. Last April, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, a prominent voice on the Senate s Intelligence Committee, urged the Senate to adopt basic cybersecurity practices, including two-factor authentication to protect its email accounts and other sensitive internal digital systems. The fact that this isn t standard practice on Capitol Hill is alarming, to say the least. While there s a tendency to speak of the DNC hack and Russian disinformation efforts in the past tense, as we learn about them, Trend Micro s report underlines the active, ongoing nature of threats to U.S. political systems one that s only going to escalate as we move into 2018 s U.S. midterm elections.\n",

      "The order to roll back net neutrality may have been made (though it s not quite in effect yet), but the fight to restore it is ongoing. Twenty-four members of Congress have asked the FCC for answers on a variety of topics relating to the huge and controversial comment docket for the Restoring Internet Freedom order, with a due date of March 6. The letter, from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Democrats, can be read in its entirety here; a few highlights from the 16 multi-part questions can be found below: How did the FCC decide how to handle the unprecedented volume of comments files? Was there discussion of how best to do so? What resources were dedicated to this immense task? How were comments determined to be devoid of substance ? How were others determined to bear substantively on the issue? What were the training methods and guidelines for staff making these determinations? How many staff hours were dedicated to this? Several members of this Committee filed comments in the docket of this proceeding, yet a number of the arguments raised in those comments were either dismissed out of hand or overlooked entirely. How did the Commission decide which arguments filed by members of Congress should not be considered? (That s a nasty one.) Why did the FCC fail to cite a single consumer comment in the order? Why has the FCC failed to cooperate with the NY attorney general s investigation into potential identity theft? Why did the FCC choose to not implement any kind of identity verification in its comment platform? The FCC says it excluded comments that used fake names, but how was it determined which these were? And if it is known which comments used fake names, why were these comments not removed from the docket? Internal communications, analysis and documents are requested for most of these questions. This isn t the first such letter to be sent to Chairman Pai, and it probably won t be the last. While he and his staff have responded to some more or less publicly, other letters may not have been published widely. So there s no reason to think he won t respond, although if previous replies are any indication, the answers to these questions may be less informative than Congress (and we) would like.

      "Uber has denied that its sitting CTO, Thuan Pham, met with Cambridge Analytica — the controversial political consultancy at the center of a Facebook user data misuse scandal. But it has not been able to confirm that no meetings between anyone else on its payroll and Cambridge Analytica took place. “I m not sure who they think they met with, but I can confirm our CTO never met with them and we don t have a relationship with them,” an Uber spokeswoman told us. Giving evidence to the UK parliament earlier this week, former Cambridge Analytica staffer, Brittany Kaiser, had claimed that CA executives met with the Uber CTO in the past two years. Although she did not explicitly name Pham — just citing the CTO job title. The UK parliament’s DCMS committee is running an enquiry into disinformation online. Asked by the committee whether she had ever come across Uber data being used for any of the political campaigns that CA worked on, Kaiser replied “no”. However she qualified her answer, adding: “Although Cambridge Analytica definitely had meetings with the CTO of Uber in California — about 1.5 to 2 years ago. “I don’t believe anything came of that but a conversation was had,” she also said. The committee did not query her on the intent of the meetings with Uber — although later she was asked if she’d had any contacts with other “big data companies”, including Google. Responding on that Kaiser confirmed she had had contacts with “Microsoft, Google and a few other companies of that nature, and Facebook” — though she said this was only in a standard business capacity, noting that CA was a client “purchasing digital advertising space through them”. On Facebook she added: “They had two different political teams in the United States — so they had their Republican team and their Democrat team, who usually inhabited separate offices on separate floors. My consultants in Washington DC would work closely with the Republican team on how we would use their tools to the best benefit for our clients.” Last month the committee also asked another ex-CA employee, whistleblower Chris Wylie, whether the company had access to Uber data — apparently concerned that a 2016 Uber data breach, affecting 57 million riders and drivers (which the company only disclosed in November last year) could have been another data source for CA. “To my knowledge Cambridge Analytica has not used Uber data,” responded Wylie. Uber told Congress last year that one of the hackers behind the 2016 breach was located in Canada — and that this hacker had first contacted it in November 2016 to demand a six-figure payment for the breached data. Also located in Canada: Aggregate IQ, a data firm that has been linked to CA — which Wylie has described as the Canadian affiliate of CA’s parent entity, SCL — and which has been credited with playing a major role in the UK’s brexit referendum, receiving 3.5M from leave campaign groups in the run up to the 2016 referendum. (AIQ has denied it has ever been a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL.) The question of where this small Canadian firm obtained data on UK citizens to carry out microtargeted political advertising has been another line of enquiry pursued by the committee. “[W]here did [AggregateIQ] get the data?” queried Wylie last month in his evidence session, discussing AIQ’s involvement in the UK’s Brexit campaign. “How do you create a massive targeting operation in a country that AIQ had not previously worked in in two months? It baffles me as to how that could happen in such a short amount of time. “That is a good question. It is unfortunate that AIQ hides behind jurisdictional barriers and does not come here and answer those questions. But it is something that hopefully can be looked at as to how did it actually work.” Wylie has also alleged that AIQ “worked on projects that involved hacked material and kompromat” as well as distributing “violent videos of people being bled to death to intimidate voters”. “This is the company that played an incredibly pivotal role in politics here. Something that I would strongly recommend to the Committee is that they not only push the authorities here, but give them the support that they need in order to investigate this company and what they were doing in Brexit,” he added.\n",

      "First things first: I had a really good time watching Ready Player One. As promised, the movie feels like a chance for Steven Spielberg to return to his roots as a blockbuster filmmaker, and to take all the toys out of the box and smash them together. The film is based on Ernest Cline’s bestselling novel, with a script by Cline and Zak Penn. It’s ostensibly set in Columbus, Ohio, 30 years in the future, in a world overwhelmed by climate change and overpopulation. But Ready Player One‘s real setting is the OASIS, an enormous virtual reality world. The story’s hero is Wade Watts (played by Tye Sheridan), who spends most of his time in the OASIS, hoping to complete three challenges left behind by James Halliday, the technology’s inventor. Halliday has promised that the first person to complete the challenges will gain control of the OASIS. The film’s central achievement is bringing this virtual world to life. Rather than aiming for a photo-real effect, Spielberg has embraced the OASIS’ essentially cartoony and video game-like qualities, and after a few minutes of acclimation, I had no problem jumping back-and-forth between the movie’s digital free-for-all and its live action dystopia. It’s clear that the characters take what happens in the OASIS as seriously as anything in the “real world,” and that they see their virtual avatars as an extension or expression of their real selves, so I was happy to follow their lead. And as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Wreck-it Ralph have already shown, there can be something exhilarating about seeing elements from classic films and video games thrown together. I genuinely felt like I was 10 years old again as I watched the first big set piece, with Wade racing through the streets of New York City in his Back to the Future-style DeLorean, dodging King Kong and the Tyrannosaurus from Jurassic Park. But I also felt a rapidly growing sense of diminishing returns. True, Spielberg and other directors of his generation have openly borrowed from old movies throughout their careers. Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars were inspired by the pop culture that Spielberg and his friend George Lucas loved as kids, but those movies transformed what had come before into something new. There’s nothing quite as magical here. At its worst, Ready Player One amounts to little more than a game of spot-the-reference. And even at its best, any excitement feels more like a rapidly fading sugar rush, not the indelible thrill of Spielberg’s best work. He’s has been happy to talk about Ready Player One as a return to making movies “from the audience, for the audience,” but Spielberg’s also suggested that he has more on his mind than pure entertainment that the film is meant to highlight some of the ways that the Internet and virtual reality could be used to isolate us, to distract from the world’s very real problems. Some of that comes across in the film’s opening moments, when Wade climbs down a tower of rundown trailers. Inside each one, we can see that his neighbors are all hidden behind goggles, living in their own fantasies. But despite a few pious nods towards the importance of the real world, the film doesn’t seem very interested in the flaws of the OASIS or the dark side of the nostalgic fan culture that Wade embodies. Sure, Wade has a hard time to talking to girls, but it’s clear that when he confronts the film’s villain (a corporate executive who could never love John Hughes movies the way Wade does), we’re meant to see cheer him on as he declares, “A fanboy knows a hater.” And while Mark Rylance delivers the film’s most compelling performance as Halliday, the script falls short. By portraying the most powerful technologist in the world as a lonely, awkward but ultimately benign and Willy Wonka-ish figure, it feels strangely out-of-sync with 2018, when everyone seems to be wrestling with the damage that these digital platforms may be doing. And yet … I had a good time. I felt plenty of reservations as I left the theater, but I made my peace with them by accepting Ready Player One as the ultimate expression of geek nostalgia, with all the virtues and the limitations that implies. I suspect Spielberg and Cline have taken us as far down the pop culture rabbit hole as any movie can go. Hopefully, other filmmakers will realize that, and they’ll look elsewhere for inspiration.\n",

      "Peak Design announced its line of bags on Kickstarter in 2016. It s my favorite thing at CES 2018. The project raised $6.5 million on Kickstarter and now the company has a full product line designed for photographers and bloggers and people who just like nice things. That s me. To be clear this is not a new bag. The bag has been out for a bit but I purchased Peak Design s Everyday Backpack a day before CES started. Buying a new bag before CES was a bold move. I m not a bold guy. Tackling CES with a new bag is a potential disaster. In the past I ve used a North Face everyday carry backpack for CES. I travel with the bag and it s been to four continents and logged hundred of thousands of air miles over the last few years. That bag is my mobile office. I know exactly where everything is. But the bag also isn t the best for carrying cameras and its large size means I overpack it. I needed something different and I m pleased with the Peak Design Everyday Backpack. I bought this bag without seeing it first. The sheer amount of positive reviews made the bag seem like a winner and they re right. This bag gets everything right. Confident design. That s the best way to describe the Everyday Backpack. It s smart and solid. The bag s fabric is dense and feels incapable of being snagged or ripped yet it s still soft enough to be pleasant to the touch. There s one main pocket and several zippered sections around the bag including a laptop sleeve. The main section is secured with a novel latch. It s amazing. Made out of metal, it grabs onto one of four bars to secure the top. There s a long magnetic strip behind the bars that grabs the metal latch and holds it tight until the latch grabs the first available bar. In practice it s smooth and satisfying. It just works. The bag s layout makes it perfect to carry cameras or drones or whatever. The inside of the bag is one large cavity that s separated by sturdy dividers that can be configured in several different ways. There are large zippers on both sides of the bag that gives access to the interior compartment. This lets the wearer swing the bag off one shoulder, unzip a side and grab a camera. Camera bags have had similar dividers for decades. But it s the origami nature of these dividers that make them among the best available. The dividers have several bendable points that allows the user to configure the bag without the need of extra, smaller dividers. I love it. This design made easy work of a Canon 6D, a kit, telephoto and macro something that I couldn t do well in my North Face bag. I had one divider running parallel with the bottom to hold the camera. Then on top of the camera, I placed one divider vertically, creating two spots to hold the two lenses. I m not going to run through all the details of this bag. A few more are worth calling out: The sternum strap is fantastic. It uses clips without moving parts so it should last a lifetime. The shoulder straps are attached to the bag with a rivet that allows the straps to swivel as needed it s a smart advancement in the design of a backpack. And inside the laptop sleeve is a small pocket that is absolutely perfect to hold a Traveler s Notebook and a pen. The Peak Design Everyday Backpack is a fantastic bag. Seriously. It s capable of holding an array of cameras and lens without extra bulk. And it looks great doing it too. The Everyday Bag is a bit costly with an average price just under $300. The cost is the only downside I see. Similar bags from Tenba, Incase and countless others can be had for half the price of the Everyday Bag. It s hard to justify the price but I after using the bag for several days, I can confidently say it s a fantastic product and I m happy with my purchase. This bag is the best thing I saw at CES 2018 even though it s not new. I m in love.\n",

      "Cambassy is a new app that lets you share the favorite things about your town, city, or country. You can think of it as a sort of breadcrumb travelogue that you leave behind for others to find and lets you include phots, tips, and comments about your favorite locations. Created by Khalid Twaim and Omar Rabea, the company one a pitch-off in Oman and showed their early versions at Disrupt in Berlin. The current version is available for iOS and Android. Cambassy is similar to Trip Advisor, Lonely Planet, and Instagram in terms of travel inspiration, said Twaim. Cambassy inspires users to travel too but the inspiration is through people from their country which is a new way of inspiring. The Cambassy team found difficulty in finding great content for travel destinations around the world. While tourism information was widely available, content from people who work, study, or travel abroad was not available, said Twaim. We were missing travel ambassadors, hence the name Cambassy (Camera + Embassy), and users who represent their country are called Cambassadors. The project is still in its early stages but it already has images in a few countries including Austria and Paris. It s a clever idea and should be an interesting addition to the standard suite of travel apps.\n",

      "Netflix’s revival of Queer Eye transports five gay men around Georgia, where they remake the lives of individuals in sore need of their assistance. Each member of the “Fab Five” has their own specialty food, fashion, grooming, design and culture. This might sound like just another reality show, but as one of the Fab Five declares in the first episode, where the original show was about tolerance, the new one is about acceptance, in many forms. It’s not a preachy series, but there’s a message under the surface, and the politics occasionally burst out into the open. And as we admit in the latest episode of the Original Content podcast, the new Queer Eye formula ends up being surprisingly affecting we won’t name names, but more than one of us found themselves crying at the end of episodes. We also cover some of the week’s streaming and entertainment news, specifically MoviePass’ acquisition of Moviefone and a plagiarism lawsuit against the creators of Stranger Things.

With its original plan, subscribers can watch up to one movie a day, every day. This comes after MoviePass removed this subscription last month in favor for a promotional $29.95 three-month plan that only let people see four movies a month.

But there’s another service on the market that’s caught my eye as of late. It’s called Sinemia, which costs $15.99 a month for three movies per month.

      "Twitch s new reality show featuring up-and-coming streamers will premiere on March 8, the company announced this morning, along with the list of the 14 personalities selected to participate. The video stars will be competing over an 11-week period for the chance to win $60,000, paid out as $5,000-per-month installments, meant to help fund their streaming careers. Stream On, as the show is called, was first announced back in December, when Twitch explained the idea behind the series was to showcase Twitch Partners who were on the cusp of breaking out, but could benefit from additional exposure. That is, the show won t feature those whose fan bases are still small, or who are somewhat inexperienced with streaming; but it also won t feature creators who are already well-known. Twitch today released the list of creators who have been chosen to compete, following their auditions. That list includes: 88bitmusic, Banzaibaby, CiraCorellia, CookingforN00bs, FerociouslySteph, GlanFM, Koibu, MajinTaj,Suchikuchi, thaButtress, TheOnlyRyann, TheStaceyRoy, Wavy and Xmiramira. Some are known for their creative talents beyond gaming like cooking, music or art areas into which Twitch has expanded over the years, as with the launch of its Creative channel in fall 2015. The show itself will be produced in-house by Twitch Studios, which is also responsible for other Twitch community content, including Twitch Weekly; a sneaker culture-focused show FreshStock; the mini-documentary Ironsights; and Twitch s convention stage coverage. While Twitch Studios has handled production for some competitive gaming events on stages at various events like PAX and TwitchCon, it hasn t yet produced any live show of this size and scope. Throughout the 11-week period when Stream On airs live on Twitch, the creators will have their streamer skills tested. For example, they ll be presented challenges like getting their viewers to respond to calls-to-action, while having their performances analyzed by judges. Viewers are meant to interact in real-time by watching, cheering and participating in challenges. They will also vote to save creators from elimination using a custom-built extension overlay on the channel page. As you may have guessed, the show isn t just meant to be something fun to watch it has a larger purpose for Twitch. Not only will it help raise the visibility of various performers who will then, in turn, attract more viewers to Twitch s platform, it will also serve as an educational experience for those streamers who want to learn how to make it big. Our mission at Twitch is to enable creators to make a living doing what they love, said Marcus djWHEAT Graham, director of Twitch Studios, in a statement about the show s upcoming premiere. With Stream On our goal is to help not just these 14 streamers, but show the thousands at home how to turn their passions into a career. Twitch isn t the only creator-focused streaming site to invest funds meant to fuel the next round of talent. YouTube does this as well, most recently with its announcement last month of a $5 million investment in positive content, and hundreds of millions into original productions for YouTube Red. Meanwhile, Musical.ly in December announced a $50 million creator fund, following its acquisition by Chinese social media giant Toutiao, owned by Bytedance. Twitch also today announced a partnership with the 1,000 Dreams Fund, which will dole out grants ranging from $500 to $2,000 to four or more female Twitch creators in 2018. Twitch s Stream On will air every Thursday at the same time (3:00 PM), after its March 8 premiere.\n",

To me it s a satisfying mix of adventure and mindless pleasure. The sequel is now available on iOS and it s even better than the first. As Darrell explains here, the new game has the same magic as the original, but this time Alto is carving up sand dunes instead of ski slopes. There are multiple landscapes, complete with castles, hot air balloons, water, shipwrecks and all sorts of gorgeous bits that make up the beautiful game. But no llamas. Thankfully the game still feels like Alto s adventure, but with more to experience and explore. The game costs $4.99 and is currently only available on iOS.

      "The majority of Twitch s product announcements lately have been focused around new tools or expanded money-making opportunities for its video creators. Today, the company is instead launching new features for viewers one related to Twitch s 60-second video snippets called Clips and another to its virtual tipping mechanism, Cheering. Starting today, Clip Champs and Top Cheerers, as these new features are called, will begin rolling out. The goal is with the additions is to better recognize those fans who regularly engage with and share creators content. Viewers who publish at least one video clip from a channel per week over the course of four weeks can earn Clip Champ status, as long as those Clips combined deliver a total of 50 views from other Twitch users or higher. Clip Champs will be rewarded for their activity with a badge that s visible in chat, on Clips sharing pages, on Clips tabs on the channel pages, and on game directory pages, says Twitch. Meanwhile, Top Cheerers is another way Twitch will begin to highlight a channel s top fans. In a leaderboard that appears in Partner and Affiliate Channels, the top three viewers who have Cheered the most will be displayed while the board is minimized. If you click to expand the leaderboard, you can see the top 10. Cheering is a way fans reward their favorite creators by using special animated emotes in chat that are bought using virtual goods called Bits. This form of online tipping has been popular across chat platforms for some time, and has become the standard way gaming fans today tip creators on sites including not only Twitch, but also YouTube Gaming, Facebook Live, Periscope, and now Microsoft Mixer. By pitting fans against one another to see who has cheered/tipped the most, Twitch could potentially encourage increased spending by the channel s viewers who want to be perceived as a top fan. This leaderboard offers two modes. One is a weekly mode that resets every seven days, so it won t necessarily be dominated by all the same names (unless some fans are set on outspending others). The other is an all-time mode, which shows the top cheerers to date. In addition to leaderboard status, the top 3 fans will receive a chat badge, Twitch notes. Hundreds of thousands of creators are able to generate revenue on Twitch thanks to the support they get from their passionate communities, said Justin Oh, Product Marketing Manager at Twitch, in a statement about the launch. With Clip Champs and Top Cheerers, supportive viewers are able to get proper recognition for the role they play in the creator s success. The Top Cheerers feature will be turned on by default for all streamers that already have the Pin Top Cheer on. If it s off, they will also be off, says Twitch. Clip Champs, meanwhile, is on by default. We understand these new features will begin rolling out today, with Clip Champs going live immediately. Top Cheerers will launch closer to the end of the month.\n",

      "We’re exactly 28 days away from the premiere of The Handmaid’s Tale Season 2. That may seem like a long time, but Hulu has mercifully released a new trailer. The first season ended on the same note as Margaret Atwood’s novel by the same name, with Ofred in a van not knowing whether she was headed toward freedom or punishment for her rebellion. Season 2 marks the series departure from the book that it’s based on, moving into uncharted territory. In the trailer, we see a number of familiar faces, including Ofred, Moira, Nick, Serena Joy, Commander Waterford, and Aunt Lydia, along with a few new faces. We also get a glimpse into the Colonies, which were spoken of quite a bit in the first Season but never shown. The Handmaid’s Tale received critical acclaim last year, and even took home four Emmys last year for Outstanding Drama Series, Support Actress, Lead Actress, and Writing for a Drama Series. Season 2 premiers on April 25 on Hulu.\n",

We understand that s because it s still experimental and has been region-blocked specifically it s limited to the US right now. Judging by reports from some US Twitter users, it s not even universally available within the US either. Google declined to comment when we asked about its rollout intentions for the feature. So if you re really desperate to try it out then you could try signing up to a (reputable) VPN with a US exit node to workaround the region-block. Or else you could just enjoy the rest of the app s features such as virtual art tours, info about nearby museums and cultural events, and an art recognizer feature that uses computer vision so you can point your phone at an artwork and be served tidbits of info about it. Alternative apps for turning your selfies into faux works of art are also available.\n",

      "Apple has landed its first half-hour comedy series, according to a new report from The Hollywood Reporter out this afternoon. The series, which will be exec-produced by and star SNL vet Kristen Wiig, hails from Reese Witherspoon s Hello Sunshine. This is the third project from Hello Sunshine that Apple has picked up to aid in its streaming TV ambitions. Others include a Jennifer Aniston and Witherspoon drama, focused on a fictional version of the morning TV show world, and a thriller starring Octavia Spencer called Are You Sleeping, which will delve into America s love affair with true crime podcasts. Apple also recently greenlit a documentary series about extraordinary homes, a revival of Amazing Stories exec-produced by Steven Spielberg and a new space drama from Battlestar Galactica s creator Ronald D. Moore, called See. According to THR s report, Apple beat out multiple outlets for the 10-episode comedy, which is inspired by Curtis Sittenfeld s upcoming short-story collection You Think It, I ll Say It. Wiig and Witherspoon will exec-produce the new show, along with Hello Sunshine s Lauren Neustadter and show runner/series creator Colleen McGuinness. Sittenfeld will consult. Wiig represents yet another high-profile win for Apple in terms of talent. The actress was Emmy nominated three times for her work on SNL, and was Oscar nominated for co-writing Bridesmaids, a film in which she also starred. More recently, she s appeared in films including Ghostbusters, Downsizing and Netflix s Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later. THR notes this new series will be Apple s fifth scripted show, and more may be on the way. Apple is currently bidding against HBO for J.J. Abrams first script since Fringe.

      "The latest game from Monument Valley designer Ken Wong doesn t have much in common with the brilliant pastel puzzler, but that doesn t mean it isn t worth experiencing. Florence, available now in the App Store, isn t really a game so much as a graphic novel strewn with a few interactive moments, kind of like quicktime events but pleasant instead of annoying. You ll brush teeth, organize records and populate conversation bubbles, and those events just lead to the next chapter of the story, like turning a page. Florence doesn t offer whimsical puzzles, new worlds awash in color or angular, ambiguously benevolent crows, but it s an entirely different category of app, so why would it? (Mild spoilers from here on out.) Florence is bite-sized, lovely and not particularly profound. In the game, you ll play as a young woman moving into adulthood. Your mom will call and badger you about getting a boyfriend periodically, and lo, one day you literally run into one. These events all play out with swipes and touch-based interactions that make them feel more like an innocent adult storybook than anything as deep and interactive as the material the creator is known for. Florence s storytelling is quiet and reflective, capturing the arc of a relationship in all of its acts. You ll go on some dates, fall in love and move in together (that was fast), transitioning to the mundane routine of cohabitating before things start to grow stale. Because I was hoping the game would offer more in the way of choosing my own adventure, it was disappointing when my in-game relationship with Krish suddenly fell apart when it still felt salvageable. The story marched on, but I really thought we had a shot if a branching path might lead us off to couple s therapy or even an erotic third to spice things up. Maybe a puppy? Alas, there was no such path. It s not clear that my character ever had sex with her Krish (the whole thing is very PG), so I worried about that too. Maybe if you guys had spent more time making out and less time reorganizing your shelves, this could have worked out! Krish also didn t seem to foster the main character s artistic inclinations while fixating on his own music career, so I couldn t figure out if he was supposed to be a jerk or not. Men are confusing, but at least he was cute. I digress. The moral of the story works out to something like you don t need another person to be happy, but you probably do need a cat. Florence might be a nice suggestion for friends going through a breakup, a kind of thoughtful salve that reminds them that the hard parts won t last forever and at the end you ll be painting with watercolors in your cute studio with a cat named Loaf. Loaf! The scope of Florence is so small that it s truly not fair to compare it to Wong s best-known work, though as a Monument Valley fan, I too could play endless variations of that game for the rest of time and be happy about it. What Florence does share with Monument Valley are its best qualities: thoughtful design, beautiful art and a serene gaming experience. Florence isn t a revelation, but it s very lovely when judged on its own merits just adjust your expectations accordingly.\n",

That already narrows things down quite a bit you ve got pudding, pecan pie, peanut brittle… Then, of course, there s Popsicle a fact the company might well be alluding to in its new Spring Wallpaper Collection. 9to5Google noted a colorful array of frozen confections in amongst the selections. Granted, it s not thematically too far from the rest of the outdoor, sunshine-themed offerings. Google s never shied away from such cheeky suggestions and it s certainly teased us before, including in the lead up to Oreo. Though that could just as easily mean it s a bit of a red herring remember Android Pocky? It s worth noting that Popsicle is, in fact, still a trademarked name like Kleenex and Xerox and Frisbee. Of course, that hasn t stopped Google in the past. See such recent examples as Kit-Kat and Oreo. And while Popsicle-owner Unilever has flexed its muscles maintaining its ownership of the name, it s hard to imagine a better/cheaper promotion than stamping your name across the latest build of the world s most popular mobile operating system. There is, of course, the issue of the fact that the Popsicle name isn t as globally synonymous with the ice pop as it is here in the States. You may know it, perhaps, as an ice lolly, ice block or ice drop, depending on where you happen to be reading this.

No Final Fantasy VII remake details and nothing on The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. The hyped presentation did have plenty to share on a new Tomb Raider title, to which they devoted about seven minutes of their half-hour presser. They also spent a lot of time with close-ups of the tornadoes that will be blaring around in Just Cause 4, which is getting a December release date. The extreme weather looks pretty cool, actually, and, given that a lot of the Just Cause series seems to be about just finding the limits of weird stuff you can do with the game’s wonky physics, this seems like it’d be pretty clutch. Outside of that, there was a sneak peek at a new title called The Quiet Man, which at first glance seems to be a title devoted to a deaf man punching Hispanic dudes in alleys throughout New York. Babylon s Fall is also new. Additionally we saw the Kingdom Hearts III trailer we saw at the Microsoft event yesterday, along with a deeper look into Captain Spirit, which looks cute, but I find it difficult to get super excited about. Other trailered games included Nier: Automata: Become As Gods, Octopath Traveler, Dragon Quest XI, Under the Moonlight, Monster Hunter World and Stormblood.

      "CancerAid, a self-reporting and symptom monitoring tool for cancer patients, has scored its first major coup in the U.S. healthcare market with its integration into Epic Systems electronic health records at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles and an integration with Apple’s HealthKit. Cedars, an investor in the company through an accelerator program it ran in conjunction with Techstars, marks the first U.S. hospital system to incorporate CancerAid’s self-reporting information into a dashboard system for doctors. It’s been a long road for company co-founders Raghav Murali-Ganesh and Nikhil Pooviah, who first met eight years ago at the Chris O’Brien Lifehouse, a Sydney, Australia cancer treatment center. Pooviah was a resident working with Murali-Ganesh in radiation oncology, positions the two men occupied for several years before venturing off on their own to launch the service that would become CancerAid. The company’s initial inspiration came from years spent checking out the tools that were already in the market for cancer patients — tools like Chemo Calendar that helped with things like scheduling and monitoring appointments. Instead of studying for some particularly tricky upcoming exams, Pooviah was spending time developing a patient-facing self-reporting symptom tracker and a community portal for cancer patients to discuss, share and monitor their own symptoms. It was that first tool that won the company acceptance into the Cedars Sinai accelerator and a competitive position in TechCrunch’s inaugural Startup Battlefield competition in Sydney, Australia. From its initial development, CancerAid now has four primary functions. On the patient side, there’s personalized cancer information for patients after their initial diagnosis. The company also provides a personal journal and symptom journal for patients to report on how they’re feeling, both emotionally and physically, as they progress through their treatment. A feature the company calls “Champions” was added so that family and friends could keep up with patients and encourage them. And finally, the company added a social networking feature so patients could connect with a broader community of patients and survivors. Now, the company has added “ClinicianLink,” a clinician-facing dashboard that sits in Epic and integrates with the existing workflows of nurses, oncologists, radiologists and the rest of the hospital administration and operational staff that touches patients as they undergo treatment. The company expects to lock in six-figure licensing deals for hospital systems to access the entire toolkit and offer it to patients. For hospitals, there’s some research that suggests simply by reporting their symptoms patients can improve their own outcomes, because doctors have a better sense on more regular intervals of the potential problems their patients face, the company said. “Patients will be able to use the patient-facing app at home, with a feedback loop back to their care team (physicians, nurses) in the hospital in real-time,” wrote Pooviah in an email. “This feedback loop helps reduce [emergency room] visits and 30 day readmissions (saving $19,000 per patient per year).” Beyond the Epic integration, CancerAid is also integrating with HealthKit — so that Apple wearables will be able to have the CancerAid functionality, the company said. The company has 20,000 patients on the app already, and is being used in 80 of the 200 largest U.S. health systems, according to Pooviah. Backed by $1.9 million in funding from strategic and financial investors, including Cedars-Sinai Health System, Techstars, Australia’s Shark Tank, Slingshot Ventures and Artesian Capital, the company is looking to expand in the U.S. through a dedicated subsidiary as it concentrates on one of the world’s largest healthcare markets.\n",

      "Genetic testing powerhouse 23andMe announced today that it s officially received the FDA go-ahead to launch a direct-to-consumer testing kit for genes linked to various forms of cancer. The forthcoming kit, which will be made available without a prescription, tests for BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are linked to higher risk of ovarian, break and prostate cancer. Being the first and only direct-to-consumer genetics company to receive FDA authorization to test for cancer risk without a prescription is a major milestone for 23andMe and for the consumer, the company s CEO Anne Wojcicki said in a release tied to the announcement. We believe it s important for consumers to have direct and affordable access to this potentially life-saving information. We will continue pioneering a path for greater access to health information, and promoting a more consumer-driven, preventative approach to health care. Of course, the test shouldn t be taken as the be all, end all of cancer risk nor is it meant as a replacement for a proper screening. As geneticist Eric Topol notes on The Verge, the three variants tested here only make up a small percentage of hundreds of known mutations. The test has the potential to provide a false sense of safety among consumers. Topol s warning reflects an FDA letter sent to the service back in 2013, urging 23andMe to discontinue marketing its Saliva Collection Kit and Personal Genome Service. Some of the uses for which PGS is intended are particularly concerning, the FDA writes, such as assessments for BRCA-related genetic risk and drug responses (e.g., warfarin sensitivity, clopidogrel response, and 5-fluorouracil toxicity) because of the potential health consequences that could result from false positive or false negative assessments for high-risk indications such as these. The three variants of the gene are found most often in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, with one in 40 people of that background carrying one. In women, the presence of one of the variants increases breast cancer risk by up to 85 percent before age 70. As the service notes, around half of BRCA carriers who offered medical history in a study don t report cancer history among immediate relatives. In that respect, the service could potentially raise a red flag and lead customers to get an additional screen. But, of course, the results of the test should in no way be taken as a replacement for a visit to the doctor.\n",

      "I don t like tech conferences. I mean, of course I don t, they re not meant for people like me. I m an introvert, so I find them exhausting, and am (presumably) less likely than an extrovert to meet interesting or contributory people. I read much faster than people talk, so they re not a good way for me to learn things. But there s more to my dislike than that. I find that the actual goal of conferences often seems to be quite distinct from the notional goal. The notional goal is for people to come together to learn about the field in question: some detailed specifics, some new announcements, and an overall general view of the state of the art, all under one roof. Maybe, if all goes well, to even find people to collaborate with in the future. To the extent that conferences do those things, they re great. But at too many conferences, those intentions often seem to be incidental to the actual goal, which is to reify the importance and social status of the conference organizers and speakers, while in practice all else is secondary. Obviously this wouldn t be true, or at least wouldn t matter, if people were actually getting their money s worth from the pearls of wisdom their VIP speakers drop on stage. But are they really? Speaking as an occasional alleged pearl-of-wisdom dropper myself, let me assure you: I have serious doubts. There seems to be a widespread mindset that all you really need to succeed is insight. That you just need to learn a little more, to integrate one more dose of perspicacity from some billionaire or guru, and then you too will have assembled enough of an arsenal of wisdom to overcome any of life s or business s obstacles. That what separates success from failure is a sufficiency of sage advice. This seems to be especially common among those who revere academia, or their idea of academia. The problem is this: it s not true. Very few pearls or even paragraphs of wisdom ever actually translate into any kind of actionable plan. What s more, if you look hard you can probably find unimpeachable wisdom arguing all sides of any given situation. Meanwhile, if you re doing something genuinely interesting, then nobody really knows what the hell is going to work or not yet; and if you aren t, then a dozen others are doing it too, and execution, rather than a little extra abstruse understanding is going to make the difference. Either way, pearls of wisdom seem pretty extraneous. What does help is learning from others mistakes, when and only when the context of those mistakes is comparable to yours but it s rare for conferences to invite speakers to talk about their mistakes. Rather, VIP speakers talk about how they made it, and while doing so are incentivized by basic human nature to overstate their own contributions to their success, and understate those of external forces meaning the wisdom they re doling out is almost always heavily skewed by (frequently unconscious) self-serving bias. Far better than listening to pearls of wisdom is hearing people being challenged professionally. Again, that s rare although it does happen. It s why I like TechCrunch s conferences. (I know, I know, you re thinking of course he d say that, but it s actually true. I vote with my feet; I can get into most tech conferences for free, and almost never do, but I always attend Disrupt.) This is because of the Battlefield format, in which a clutch of startups get to introduce themselves, which is mildly interesting and then get grilled by skeptical industry experts live on-stage, which is the good bit. I also like unconferences, where you re more likely to hear war stories and learn from others mistakes, rather than be expected to sit at the feet of lionized gurus and feed on what crusts of wisdom they might choose to drop. All too many formal, paid conferences, though, are part of what I call the insight-industrial complex : people flock to them to hear quasi-famous people rattle off pseudo-wise sound bites devoid of any actual value. This applies very much to social media, too, of course. Twitter is clearly the grassroots of the insight-industrial complex. Being insightful is not actually that important. No, really. Here s an even more heretical thought: even being intelligent is not actually that important, whether you measure importance by success, happiness, or influence. What matters most is often usually execution, not wisdom; attention to detail, not vision. I m aware of the irony that most of this essay, as with most of my TC columns, is itself structured to consist of sound bites that are arguably sort of striving in at least a vaguely insightful direction. But bear in mind you re reading this for free, while conferences cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. By all means, go to them to network, to get an overview of your field, to witness people being challenged, and to learn from others mistakes. But don t go because they feature speakers from the insight-industrial complex.\n",

      "Nokia s health division, which is the result of the Withings acquisition, is announcing some new stuff at CES in Las Vegas. First, there s a new sleep sensor called Nokia Sleep. In addition to monitoring your sleep, the device can help you trigger actions using IFTTT when you fall asleep and wake up. Withings already had a sleep-focused device called the Withings Aura. It was a package with both a sleep sensor and a bedside unit with an alarm and a speaker. Nokia is dropping the bedside unit and the price tag of its new device. The new sensor works using Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth LE and is going to ship at some point during the first quarter of 2018 for $100. After putting the device under your mattress, you can look at your sleep cycles in the Nokia Health Mate app, such as light sleep, deep sleep and rapid-eye-movements phases. The Nokia Sleep can also track your snoring. But the best feature is that the device works with IFTTT. You can pair the Nokia Sleep with other devices in case you re really into automation. For instance, when you wake up in the morning, the Nokia Sleep could tell IFTTT to switch on the lights, raise the temperature, open the blinds and more. In addition to this new device, Nokia is shipping an update to the Nokia Health Mate app. It now integrates with Alexa, which means that you can ask your Amazon Echo about your sleep or your weight. The Alexa skill is now available in beta. Nokia is also releasing a rose gold version of the Nokia Steel HR smartwatch. It will cost between $180 and $250 with a silicone or leather band and it s going to be available next month.\n",

      "Food security is one of the grand problems facing the planet this century. The UN has estimated that food supplies need to increase by 50 percent to cover the population growth expected over the coming decades, while climate change is expected to cut crop yields by a quarter. Nearly a billion people today lack sufficient food. Those are raw statistics, but Justin Kolbeck saw them viscerally personified every day as a U.S. diplomat in Afghanistan, where food security is a perennial concern. Things were so bad that people were smuggling meat over the Pakistan border, he said, despite the incredible danger along that heavily guarded dividing line. Kolbeck eventually returned to the U.S., where he met Arye Elfenbein, who was studying for an MD/PhD in cardiology. Elfenbein s research looked at how the heart could regrow functional muscle tissue lost in a heart attack. As he worked on his residency though, he realized that some of the fields he was working on, including tissue engineering, stem cell biology, and cell development could intersect and not just solve heart problems but could feed the world. Together, the two co-founded Wild Type, which netted a $3.5 million seed round led by Spark Capital, with participation from Root Ventures, Mission Bay Capital, and a group of angels. The name comes from the wild type term in biology, which means that something exists naturally, but also has the connotation of animals roaming outside. Kolbeck and Elfenbein s mission is to develop a platform and set of technologies that would allow any meat to be cultured in the lab using well-defined procedures. The two are stealthy around their technology, which is still in development. But the essential concept is to multiply basic animal cells in the lab and effectively culture meat. This means that the meat is fundamentally meat, and not a meat substitute using plant cells like Impossible Foods Impossible Burger. Rather than starting from scratch for every type of protein, the technology could apply across all kinds of different animal species using the evolutionary heritage common to all of them. We didn t want to build a tool that could just be used for beef, or a specific type of chicken, or a specific fish, Kolbeck explained. The synergy of different scientific disciplines has been enticing to scientists according to Elfenbein. Scientists in general and who we spoke to about this idea were really fascinated that emerging technologies could be applied to something so different from the biomedical sciences, he said. Although the food is being developed in the lab, it is being tested regularly by chefs. We wanted to make sure we were building something that people would love, so from day one we reached out to friends in the food business, Kolbeck said. Wild Type isn t just focused on the taste and texture of the meat, but is also investigating whether it could grow meat in a certain way that would make it easier to use in a kitchen. Wild Type s first meat is salmon. Phase one is to develop a minced salmon meat that could be used in say a spicy salmon sushi roll, where the meat is mixed with sauce and smaller quantities are needed. From there, the company is targeting lox for bagels, and eventually, salmon filets. Spark Capital investor John Melas-Kyriazi led the round and will be joining the company s board. This is an area we have been interested in for a long time at Spark: What is the protein source that is going to feed the world over the next 50 to 100 years, he asked. He loved Wild Type s product focus, of actually creating a product that people want that stands for delicious food and not for something else. He invested after trying a helping of Wild Type s food during due diligence. Wild Type hopes to use the seed round to invest in scaling up its cellular growth infrastructure, lowering the cost of its meat while also increasing its manufacturing capability. The company has a team of five today.\n",

      "Hawaiian residents were briefly but intensely disturbed this morning by a state-wide alert via TV and phone warning of an incoming ballistic missile. It was, however, shortly afterwards confirmed to be a mistake caused by human error. Hawaiian Senator Brian Schatz called the false alarm inexcusable and said to expect tough and quick accountability and a fixed process. The alert went out at a little after 8 AM Hawaiian time, appearing on phones as an emergency services popup and broadcast on TV as a detailed warning of how to seek shelter. This is not a drill, it concluded. Authorities quickly issued followups to calm the no doubt panicking populace, but I imagine it s hard to do that properly when you ve just told everyone in the state to seek shelter and lie on the floor. NO missile threat to Hawaii. Hawaii EMA (@Hawaii_EMA) January 13, 2018 Given the current state of international relations, particularly with North Korea, it s hard to imagine how a simple human error could have resulted in such a major alert. In a statement issued a few hours later, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency explained in a bit more detail what happened: Approx. 8:05 a.m. A routine internal test during a shift change was initiated. This was a test that involved the Emergency Alert System, the Wireless Emergency Alert, but no warning sirens. 8:07 a.m. A warning test was triggered statewide by the State Warning Point, HI-EMA. The local military representative checked with USPACOM that no launch had actually happened by 8:10, and at 8:13 the alert was cancelled. Social media and other online explanations appeared starting a few minutes after that, and official messages saying There is no missile threat to Hawaii were spread via the broadcast system at 8:45 So what exactly happened? It still isn t completely clear, but it sounds like a test of the system that was meant to stay internal ended up getting out. In order to prevent this from happening again, HI-EMA is taking three measures, as explained in the statement: On the recommendations of the HI-EMA Administrator, Vern Miyagi, the Governor has suspended all future drills until HI-EMA has completed a full analysis of the event. HI-EMA has already instituted a two-person activation/verification rule for tests as well as actual missile launch notifications. A cancellation command that can be done automatically that can be triggered within seconds of an error, has been put in place. This of course makes it clear that a single person could activate the tests and real warnings, which seems risky, and that once initiated it was not easy to cancel them (perhaps by design). Put these together and there s certainly a large risk of mistake or misuse. HI-EMA is also evaluating the possibility of expanding notification processes for officials for situations like this. A full report will be made next week. In the mean time it may be wise for other states to check whether their systems are similarly at risk for a false alarm.\n",

      "Avro, a life sciences startup in Y Combinator s current batch, is banking on a method to deliver medications to populations unable to swallow or chew it will administer them through the skin. Starting with allergy medications, the startup is developing skin patches that release drugs commonly used in seasonal allergies for children. The patches act much like nicotine patches, which deliver nicotine to those trying to quit smoking, but can deliver a variety of drugs, such as allergy medications, through our body s largest organ. Co-founder Shakir Lakhani, who suffers from both seasonal and food allergies himself, tells TechCrunch he wanted to start with allergy relief not just for personal reasons but because it s an area where children are resistant to taking the medications already out there. There s medications that say they taste like banana but don t really taste like banana, he said. The drugs are also relatively safe so it s something we can work with without being too worried. It s also not the first company to offer transdermal drug delivery. Miami-based pharmaceutical company ProSolus creates skin patches for delivery of various generic drugs and over-the-counter products, Fremont outfit Zosano makes specialty transdermal patches for delivery of migraine-reducing medicines and Viaskin is making a patch for kids with peanut allergies though clinical trials have so far not gone well. These companies could easily start offering the same types of patches as Avro, should the startup prove the market need. One advantage is that the drugs Avro wants to use in its patches are already out there it wouldn t need to prove they work. They just need to prove the delivery method is safe and effective. But the startup has a long way to go before getting these patches into the hands of consumers. First, Avro will need FDA approval to sell in the United States and Canada, where the company plans to market its patches. To get there, it will need to conduct some human clinical trials, which Lakhani says he s in the process of looking into at the moment but believes he ll be able to get up and running in Q3 of this year. Lakhani also mentioned his skin patches could eventually offer other types of medicines. We re looking at things like people suffering from near degenerative diseases and more intense diseases that inhibit your ability to swallow, like Multiple Sclerosis, he told TechCrunch. I think those will be really interesting avenues for us to go down in the future and we re just starting to initiate conversations with other companies who might be good partners for us.\n",

      "About one year ago, a note from a CEO thanking his employee for using sick days to take care of her mental health went viral. It was a reminder to Alyson Friedensohn of what she wants to accomplish with Modern Health, the emotional health benefits startup she founded last year with neuroscientist Erica Johnson. We want that to be normal. We want the email she sent to be normal, to be able to be that open, Friedensohn tells TechCrunch. Modern Health, a Y Combinator alum, announced today that it has raised $2.26 million in seed funding for hiring, accelerating the development of its healthcare platform and growing its network of therapists, coaches and other providers. Offered as a benefit by companies, Modern Health s services are meant to improve employee well-being and retention rates. The round was led by Afore, with participation from Social Capital, Precursor Ventures, Merus Capital, Maschmeyer Group Ventures, Y Combinator and angel investors. Friedensohn, Modern Health s chief executive officer, says six employers currently offer its platform, which includes services like counseling and career and financial coaching. One thing the startup is especially proud of is the fact that Modern Health s team is currently all female and Friedensohn wants to parlay their point of view into services that address issues affecting women. For example, the platform already works with providers who specialize in postpartum depression and infertility. People don t talk about what working moms are dealing with and countless things like that, says Friedensohn, who previously worked at health tech companies Keas and Collective Health. People don t want to talk about it because they are worried it will jeopardize their careers, but it makes a difference. Several other tech startups are working on mental health care platforms for employers to offer as a benefit, including Ginger.io, Lyra Health and Quartet, which have all have received significant amounts of funding from prominent investors. The space is especially important, given the alarming rise in the United States suicide rate and the fact that about 6.7% of all adults in the U.S. have experienced at least one major depressive episode. One of Modern Health s priorities is to reach employees before they hit a crisis point. Since many people are daunted by the idea of therapy, the platform connects them to coaches instead to focus on specific issues, like their careers, or overall emotional wellbeing. This helps referrals, Friedensohn notes, because it makes the service feel more approachable. They can say to friends, I have this awesome Modern Health coach, versus saying I have a therapist, so it s way easier for people to engage, she says. Modern Health also makes its services more accessible by offering several ways to use the platform: texting, video calls or, for people who don t want to talk to a therapist or coach yet, meditation apps and other digital tools created by the company. One of Modern Health’s newest customers, human resources startup Gusto, hit a 43% utilization rate of its services, including connecting employees to coaches and therapists, among registered users just four days after it began offering the platform. Friedensohn adds that it s not uncommon for people to write essays on their sign-up forms when registering because it s the first time they ve been able to unload their problems. People like that it s coaching, she says. What we found is that by focusing on that point, the biggest thing is lowering the barrier to entry, so that people who are depressed are also comfortable reaching out.\n",

And new research suggests it is working on AR applications that could not just modify or replace your face, but your entire body. A blog post today has the AI Camera Team showing off a bit of work clearly aimed at doing full-body replacement or tracking in a VR or AR context. We recently developed a new technology that can accurately detect body poses and segment a person from their background. Our model is still in research phase at the moment, but it is only a few megabytes, and can run on smart phones in real time, the researchers write. Of course, this type of research is far from unprecedented; skeletal tracking systems are commonplace in many industries. And indeed this blog post is more about how this particular system and its component neural networks operate than claiming any major advances. That said, Facebook is clearly looking especially into keeping things efficient and easy to deploy on mobile. That means working within many hard limitations as far as sensor data, image resolution and refresh rate, processing power available, and so on. Mask R-CNN, as the technique is called, is a nice step in this direction. We can surely expect more like this from Facebook in the future the company is even looking for a research intern dedicated to this line of research. Featured Image: Facebook\n",

      "Life sciences startups in Asia are getting another boost with the $10 million investment in Engine Biosciences a biotech company that s applying machine learning to genomics for drug discovery. With its headquarters in both Singapore and San Francisco, the company has managed to attract some impressive investors from both the U.S. and Asia. The round was co-led by Danhua Venture Capital and 6 Dimensions Capital, with additional participation from WuXi AppTec, EDBI, Pavilion Capital, Baidu Ventures, WI Harper and Nest.Bio Ventures. Founded by a who s who of researchers, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Timothy Lu and Jim Collins; Mayo Clinic Assistant professor Hu Li; and University of California San Diego assistant professor, Prashant Mali, Engine is leveraging experts in synthetic biology and drug discovery to create a new way to build and test novel medicines. According to a statement, the company will use the money to continue developing its drug discovery platform, expand the executive and scientific team in Singapore and the U.S. and begin pre-clinical studies internally and with partners which already include undisclosed research institutions and an unnamed Fortune 500 company here in the U.S. Combining parallel biological experimentation with machine learning to develop therapies, Engine is building a system for new drug discovery that is faster and cheaper to test than existing methodologies, the company claims. The biopharmaceutical industry needs better approaches for R&D to deliver therapies to patients in need faster. Legacy approaches mean that in many cases, we still have a weak understanding of what drives disease and correspondingly, how to treat or prevent it, said Engine Biosciences co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Lu, in a statement. Engine s data-driven platform allows researchers to not only uncover the critical gene interactions underlying diseases, but also test therapies that specifically target these interactions in a faster, cheaper and more precise fashion than currently possible. So far, the technology is being used for drug repositioning, which creates new applications for existing drugs; target discovery, which looks at potential biological factors for disease; precision medicine through targeting specific genes; and pathway analysis. Already the company has seen proof-of-concept successes around treatments for cancer, neurodegenerative, autoimmune disorders and skin disorders. The lack of insight into complex and multi-factorial biological processes within cells contributes to the high failure rate across the drug development cycle. Engine Biosciences has pioneered a new approach to address this by generating novel data and insights that are highly relevant to the biological process, said Dr. Leon Chen, founding CEO of 6 Dimensions Capital and a member of Engine s board of directors. We expect the company s AI platform will lead to insightful information in complex diseases pathways that was not previously possible using traditional wet lab-centric biology research and we are excited to support the team with our investment.\n",

      "According to Cardiogram founder Brandon Ballinger s latest clinical study, the Apple Watch can detect diabetes in those previously diagnosed with the disease with an 85 percent accuracy. The study is part of the larger DeepHeart study with Cardiogram and UCSF. This particular study used data from 14,000 Apple Watch users and was able to detect that 462 of them had diabetes by using the Watch s heart rate sensor, the same type of sensor other fitness bands using Android Wear also integrate into their systems. In 2015, the Framingham Heart Study showed that resting heart rate and heart rate variability significantly predicted incident diabetes and hypertension. This led to the impetus to use the Watch s heart rate sensor to see if it could accurately detect a diabetic patient. Previously, Ballinger and his colleagues were able to use Apple s Watch to detect an abnormal heart rhythm with up to a 97 percent accuracy, sleep apnea with a 90 percent accuracy and hypertension with an 82 percent accuracy when paired with Cardiogram s AI-based algorithm. Most of these discoveries have been published in clinical journals or abstracts and Ballinger intends to publish the latest findings shortly after presenting at the AAAI 2018 conference this week. Diabetes is a huge and growing problem in the U.S. More than 100 million U.S. adults are now living with pre-diabetes or diabetes and more than 1 in 4 of them go undiagnosed, according to the CDC. Part of the problem is the pain that goes into checking blood glucose levels. A patient must prick themselves after every meal and correctly take the right amount of insulin to keep themselves in balance. Early detection could also help in cutting down on diabetes-related diseases before they get out of hand. While there have been other attempts to build special-purpose glucose-sensing hardware, this is the first large-scale study showing that ordinary heart rate sensors when paired with an artificial intelligence-based algorithm can identify diabetes with no extra hardware. So what s next? Ballinger and his colleague on the study Johnson Hsieh mentioned they could be looking at a number of diseases to detect through heart sensors, possibly even gestational diabetes. Hsieh also cautions that those tested were already known to have diabetes or pre-diabetes and that anyone who thinks they might have it should go to their doctor, not just rely on the Watch to tell them what s going on. But the results are promising. We ll just have to wait and see what else the Apple Watch and other fitness monitors with a built-in heart rate sensor are able to tell us about ourselves next.\n",

      "If you ve gotten three apps and a Fitbit so you can get skinnier this year, don t worry so much about summer beach season or holiday weight gain. Instead, worry about Thursday. Researchers at University of South Carolina found that self-reporting of food was integral to weight loss but that self-reporters often fell off, seemingly around the holidays. A key question we wanted to answer is what impact the holiday season has on individuals efforts to monitor their calorie intake, said lead author Christine A. Pellegrini, PhD. They gave a dieting app to a group of 32 obese adults and asked them to self-report over various seasons. The app could tell when they reported intake, allowing the researchers to see when folks stopped reporting. From the release: After analysis of the data, a reduction in the number of foods reported by each person was seen with each successive day in the study. There was also a weekend effect such that participants reported significantly fewer foods between Thursday and Sunday relative to Monday. The study, however, determined that although more food was reported in January, an overall seasonality effect was not observed. Adults generally gain weight during the holidays and self-monitoring can help to manage weight during this period, reported Pellegrini. Weight loss is a common New Year s resolution and may explain the increased number of foods reported in January; however, the typical pattern of self-monitoring during the holidays is not well established. The researchers saw food self-reporting fall off on a weekly basis between Thursday and Sunday which suggests that we are good at reporting what we eat at the beginning of the week but, as opportunities to cheat enter our weekend radar, we slow down considerably. The bottom line? Based on this study s findings, providing these prompts on weekends may improve adherence to self-monitoring recommendations, wrote the researchers. Basically someone has to remind us not to pig out on our days of rest.\n",

      "There’s been an explosion of medical startups centering their tools around machine learning to help doctors with predictive tools and now Netflix’s former chief product officer Neil Hunt wants to enter the fray with one that hopes to get the right information from patients themselves. That’s the hope for Curai, a machine learning-driven startup that helps patients deliver the right information to doctors to help medical professionals figure out the best diagnosis and reduce the overhead for doctors so they can work with more patients without the grunt work. Patients can send photos of rashes, describe their symptoms, or MRI results and help navigate those results to come to the best conclusion with doctors and have more readily available access. And the hope is that Curai will also develop into a system that can detect potential problems from symptoms that a patient might not even realize are relevant. “We want to build a patient-facing system to commoditize healthcare knowledge, that helps patients and their doctors know and understand the decisions they ought to make, whether those are simple questions about health, diagnostic or treatment, in lots of different ways,” Hunt said. “[It’s based on] the idea that you let computers do what computers are good at, and that’s data and knowledge and reasoning and logic. You let doctors do the things that humans are good at: coaching, intuition, empathy, and helping patients make decisions.” Hunt was previously the chief product officer at Netflix. Curai’s other cofounders include Xavier Amatriain, the former VP of engineering at Quora, and Neal Khosla, a previous startup founder with a history at Stanford and Google. The company said it has raised around $10.7 million in a round that includes General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures and a variety of other angels. In a lot of ways, Curai and other startups focusing on machine learning to empower doctors to make better decisions is a response to people just searching around the Web and getting answers from Doctor Google. That, in the end, generally ends up with what can be frightening results that are probably out of line with reality, Hunt said. The idea is that if patients can give a more robust history and set of symptoms, Curai can help doctors sift out what are some of the real underlying causes. It then takes all that and packages it together in a sensible way for doctors, who will work with those patients to figure out the best treatment options. It’s supposed to be a way to get around a doctor having to pull up a medical history, which might contain either too much information or just a record so large that they have to invest a lot of time trying to sift through everything. As the company is able to collect more data (like other startups, Hunt said that’s locked down and following typically strict regulations around healthcare), those algorithms improve over time, though getting enough quality data is part of the critical process of building a competitive moat in an otherwise increasingly competitive space. “In some ways, the challenge with healthcare on the web is, you tend to discover you have cancer or diabetes, and they have nothing to do with what you came in for,” Hunt said. “If you imagine a system that can engage with the patient and [surface] the real facts and take those into consideration, like the history that a patient might not realize, it can point you to relevant information that’s something a bit more balanced.” But getting that information may be a bit of a tall order, especially for more sensitive cases where patients might not want to disclose information. I’ve actually asked about this before of David Ebersman, who runs a startup called Lyra Health focusing on mental health, and he said the challenge is giving patients the confidence that they’re navigating a safer space to operate which might help them be even more willing to work with a tool rather than expose some of those deeper problems face-to-face with someone. (Lyra Health recently announced it raised $45 million.) “There’s a good degree of evidence that suggests an impersonal consumer facing product might be easier to talk to with things like drinking or sexual partners or thing that you might be embarrassed about, or that you might feel some difficulty talking to your doctor,” Hunt said. “Certainly in some of the work we’ve done so far, there’s a much bigger lean toward the embarrassing to talk about situations than you would expect if you were a practicing physician. I would suspect people are more ready and talk sooner to an impersonal interface than they would talk to a human doctor.” There are certainly a lot of startups looking to take some of the pressure off doctors when it comes to more menial tasks ones that could easily be accomplished by computers, but haven’t quite been tackled in medical offices that come in a lot of different flavors. There are tools like Lyra Health, or a sort of “Alexa for doctors” from startups like Suki, which has also raised $20 million. All of this is designed to help take some of the workload of doctors and assist in building a better pattern-matching system, which gives them more time to work with patients.\n",

      "Drones may be a powerful tool for preserving endangered species. Researchers in Australia suggest that counting wildlife using drones is more accurate than traditional methods, according to a paper published on Tuesday in the British Ecological Society journal \"Methods in Ecology and Evolution.\" Counting a species is crucial to conservation efforts. \"With so many animals across the world facing extinction, our need for accurate wildlife data has never been greater,\" said Jarrod Hodgson, lead author of the research paper and Ph.D candidate at the University of Adelaide's School of Biological Sciences. \"Accurate monitoring can detect small changes in animal numbers. That is important because if we had to wait for a big shift in those numbers to notice the decline, it might be too late to conserve a threatened species.\" Related: New artificial intelligence system can tell if a sheep is in pain Drones have previously been used to monitor different animals, such as elephants and nesting birds. But it was uncertain how accurate drones were for counting species, according to the researchers. To test the method, the team created fake bird colonies on a beach in Adelaide, Australia, using 2,000 decoy ducks. They were modeled after Crested Tern seabirds. Wildlife experts on the ground counted the fake birds with binoculars and telescopes, while a drone flew overhead and took pictures. Another group of scientists counted the number of birds they could see from the drone images. \"In a wild population, the true number of individuals is not known. This makes it very difficult to test the accuracy of a counting approach,\" Hodgson told CNN Tech. \"We needed to test the technology where we knew the correct answer.\" The researchers found that the drone approach was more precise than counting on the ground. Because counting species in photographs is time intensive, the researchers also trained a computer algorithm to count the birds automatically. Those results were nearly as accurate as scientists reviewing the photos, according to the team. Related: Scientists predict volcanic eruptions with satellites and GPS The research paper was co-authored by scientists from the University of Adelaide, Australian Antarctic Division, University of Tasmania and Monash University. Hodgson said the researchers are still learning about how wildlife reacts to the presence of drones. \"The results will help to refine and improve drone monitoring protocols so that drones have minimal to non-existent impact on wildlife,\" he said. \"This is particularly important for species that are prone to disturbance and where traditional methods involving close proximity to species are not possible or desirable.\" The researchers are planning a similar drone test to monitor different species of seals and to detect the nests or tracks of difficult-to-observe animals. Drones aren't the only technology scientists are using to count wildlife populations. Last year, a group of researchers from the British Antarctic Survey and Canterbury Museum in New Zealand demonstrated that albatross birds can be seen and counted from space using high-resolution satellite imagery. Albatrosses, a type of big seabird, are one of the most threatened groups of birds in the world.\n",

      "What if there’s a drug that already exists that could treat a disease with no known therapies, but we just haven’t made the connection? Finding that connection by exhaustively analyzing complex biomechanics within the body with the help of machine learning, naturally is the goal of ReviveMed, a new biotech startup out of MIT that just raised $1.5 million in seed funding. Around the turn of the century, genomics was the big thing. Then, as the power to investigate complex biological processes improved, proteomics became the next frontier. We may have moved on again, this time to the yet more complex field of metabolomics, which is where ReviveMed comes in. Leila Pirhaji, ReviveMed’s founder and CEO, began work on the topic during her time as a postgrad at MIT . The problem she and her colleagues saw was the immense complexity of interactions between proteins, which are encoded in DNA and RNA, and metabolites, a class of biomolecules with even greater variety. Hidden in these innumerable interactions somewhere are clues to how and why biological processes are going wrong, and perhaps how to address that. “The interaction of proteins and metabolites tells us exactly what’s happening in the disease,” Pirhaji told me. “But there are over 40,000 metabolites in the human body. DNA and RNA are easy to measure, but metabolites have tremendous diversity in mass. Each one requires its own experiment to detect.” As you can imagine, the time and money that would be involved in such an extensive battery of testing have made metabolomics difficult to study. But what Pirhaji and her collaborators at MIT decided was that it was similar enough to other “big noisy data set” problems that the nascent approach of machine learning could be effective. “Instead of doing experiments,” Pirhaji said, “why don’t we use AI and our database?” ReviveMed, which she founded along with data scientist Demarcus Briers and biotech veteran Richard Howell, is the embodiment of that proposal. Pharmaceutical companies and research organizations already have a mess of metabolites masses, known interactions, suspected but unproven effects and disease states and outcomes. Plenty of experimentation is done, but the results are frustratingly vague owing to the inability to be sure about the metabolites themselves or what they’re doing. Most experimentation has resulted in partial understanding of a small proportion of known metabolites. That data isn’t just a few drives’ worth of spreadsheets and charts, either. Not only does the data comprise drug-protein, protein-protein, protein-metabolite and metabolite-disease interactions, but they’re including data that’s essentially never been analyzed: “We’re looking at metabolites that no one has looked at before.” The information is sitting in an archive somewhere, gathering dust. “We actually have to go physically pick up the mass spectrometry files,” Pirhaji said. (“They’re huge,” she added.) Once they got the data all in one place (Pirhaji described it as “a big hairball with millions of interactions,” in a presentation in March), they developed a model to evaluate and characterize everything in it, producing the kind of insights machine learning systems are known for. The results were more than a little promising. In a trial run, they identified new disease mechanisms for Huntington’s, new therapeutic targets (i.e. biomolecules or processes that could be affected by drugs) and existing drugs that may affect those targets. The secret sauce, or one ingredient anyway, is the ability to distinguish metabolites with similar masses (sugars or fats with different molecular configurations but the same number and type of atoms, for instance) and correlate those metabolites with both drug and protein effects and disease outcomes. The metabolome fills in the missing piece between disease and drug without any tests establishing it directly. At that point the drug will, of course, require real-world testing. But although ReviveMed does do some verification on its own, this is when the company would hand back the results to its clients, pharmaceutical companies, which then take the drug and its new effect to market. In effect, the business model is offering a low-cost, high-reward R&D as a service to pharma, which can hand over reams of data it has no particular use for, potentially resulting in practical applications for drugs that already have millions invested in their testing and manufacture. What wouldn’t Pfizer pay to determine that Robitussin also prevents Alzheimer’s? That knowledge is worth billions, and ReviveMed is offering a new, powerful way to check for such things with little in the way of new investment. ReviveMed, for its part, is being a bit more choosy than that its focus is on untreatable diseases with a good chance that existing drugs affect them. The first target is fatty liver disease, which affects millions, causing great suffering and cost. And something like Huntington’s, in which genetic triggers and disease effects are known but not the intermediate mechanisms, is also a good candidate for which the company’s models can fill the gap. The company isn’t reliant on Big Pharma for its data, though. The original training data was all public (though “very fragmented”) and it’s that on which the system is primarily based. “We have a patent on our process for getting this metabolome data and translating it into insights,” Pirhaji notes, although the work they did at MIT is available for anyone to access (it was published in Nature Methods, in case you were wondering). But compared with genomics and proteomics, not much metabolomic data is public so although ReviveMed can augment its database with data from clients, its researchers are also conducting hundreds of human tests on their own to improve the model. The business model is a bit complicated, as well “It’s very case by case,” Pirhaji told me. A research hospital looking to collaborate and share data while sharing any results publicly or as shared intellectual property, for instance, would not be a situation where a lot of cash would change hands. But a top-5 pharma company two of which ReviveMed already has dealings with that wants to keep all the results for itself and has limitless coffers would pay a higher cost. I’m oversimplifying, but you get the idea. In many cases, however, ReviveMed will aim to be a part of any intellectual property it contributes to. And of course the data provided by the clients goes into the model and improves it, which is its own form of payment. So you can see that negotiations might get complicated. But the company already has several revenue-generating pilots in place, so even at this early stage those complications are far from insurmountable. Lastly there’s the matter of the seed round: $1.5 million, led by Rivas Capital along with TechU, Team Builder Ventures and WorldQuant. This should allow them to hire the engineers and data scientists they need and expand in other practical ways. Placing well in a recent Google machine learning competition got them $200,000 worth of cloud computing credit, so that should keep them crunching for a while. ReviveMed’s approach is a fundamentally modern one that wouldn’t be possible just a few years ago, such is the scale of the data involved. It may prove to be a powerful example of data-driven biotech as lucrative as it is beneficial. Even the early proof-of-concept and pilot work may provide help to millions or save lives it’s not every day a company is founded that can say that.\n",

      "Atomwise, which uses deep learning to shorten the process of discovering new drugs, has raised a $45 million Series A. The round was led by Monsanto Growth Ventures, Data Collective (DCVC) and B Capital Group. Baidu Ventures, Tencent and Dolby Family Ventures, which are all new investors in Atomwise, also participated, as well as returning investors Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and DFJ. This means Atomwise, which was founded in 2012, has now raised more than $51 million in funding. The company, which aims to reduce the amount of money and time researchers spend on finding compounds for medications, says it now has more than 50 molecular discovery programs. Atomwise s technology is also being used to develop safer, more effective agricultural pesticides. In a press statement, Monsanto Growth Ventures partner Dr. Kiersten Stead said We chose to invest based on the impressive results we saw from Atomwise in our own hands. Atomwise was able to find promising compounds against crop protection targets that are important areas of focus for agrochemical R&D. Atomwise s software analyzes simulations of molecules, reducing the time researchers need to spend synthesizing and testing compounds. The company says it currently screens more than 10 million compounds each day. Atomwise s AtomNet system uses deep learning algorithms to analyze molecules and predict how they might act in the human body, including their potential efficacy as medication, toxicity and side effects, at an earlier stage than in the traditional drug discovery process. In an email, Atomwise chief executive officer Dr. Abraham Heifets told TechCrunch that the company s vision is to become one of the most prolific and diverse life science research groups in the world, working at a scale that is truly unprecedented. This is a large Series A and we will use these resources to grow our technical and business organization. We may eventually find ourselves simulating hundreds of millions of compounds per day. The ultimate upshot is more shots on goal for the many diseases that urgently need new treatments. Lead optimization has historically been the most expensive step in the pharma pipeline, Heifets added, adding that it also has a very high failure rate, with about two-thirds of projects failing to even make it to the clinic and it takes five and a half years to get that far. When Atomwise launched six years ago, its technology seemed almost like something out of science fiction. Now there is a roster of companies using artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze molecules and fix bottlenecks in the drug discovery process, including Recursion Pharmaceuticals, BenevolentAI, TwoXAR, Cyclica and Reverie Labs. Heifets said one of Atomwise s main advantages is the large number of projects it has worked on, which in turn improves its AI systems. The company s clients include four of the top 10 biggest pharmaceutical companies in the United States, including Merck, Monsanto, more than 40 major research universities (Harvard, Duke, Stanford and Baylor College of Medicine among them) and biotech firms. He added that Atomwise also differentiates in its focus. There are two distinct problems in drug discovery: biology and chemistry, he said. If you re working on biology, you re trying to decide which disease protein is the best one to target. A lot of AI companies in drug discovery are working on this target identification problem. Once you ve chosen a target, you can start working on chemistry problems: how to deliver a non-toxic molecule that can hit the chosen disease protein. Atomwise is focused on these chemistry problems; specifically, Atomwise invented the use of deep neural networks for structure-based drug design. Featured Image: Atomwise\n",

      "Bay Area startup Safe Catch Tuna has developed a patented technology to detect mercury levels in a variety of fish and pledges that its own brand of tuna products have the lowest levels of any brand. The company is one of those overnight successes more than a decade in the making. Co-founder Sean Wittenberg started the company in 2004 after his own mom was diagnosed with mercury poisoning. She d been eating canned tuna fish a few times a week and started to become lethargic, weak and suffer from short-term memory loss. Thankfully, she recovered, but the incident was scary enough to prompt Wittenberg to come up with a way to ensure the safety of tuna. He and his co-founder Bryan Boches started marketing the tech to some of the big tuna manufacturers but soon found they weren t interested. Unfortunately, there hasn t been much incentive for manufacturers to test all their products, and none of them seemed interested in what Safe Catch was doing despite an Environmental Protection Agency warning back then that pregnant women, nursing mothers and small children should not be consuming tuna in a can. The company nearly died in 2015 from lack of a market. That s when Wittenberg and Boches decided to pivot and become a tuna manufacturer themselves. Those guidelines were since updated in 2017, and both the EPA and FDA now say its OK for pregnant women, nursing mothers and small children to consume small amounts of tuna a few times per week, as long as it falls below the 1.0 parts per million standard suggested. Many manufacturers like StarKist and Bumble Bee say on their sites they only sell the kind of canned fish products that fall far below that standard. The biggest problem, says Boches, is the FDA and EPA are only testing about 200 fish a year from these other manufacturers, whereas Safe Catch is testing more than a million fish a year to ensure safety. We re the only brand and the only company in the world that can screen fish for mercury in real-time, Boches tells TechCrunch. Otherwise, it would take a lab a week and cost $100 for every single test, and that would mean each can would be $20 a can. It would never work. It s been a long road, and Boches admits it has been an expensive company to build, but he says Safe Catch is now at a point where it can scale. In just two years, the company went from zero to selling its products in 10,000 stores across the U.S., doubling sales each year and creating 22 SKUs. Boches says it s particularly popular with the paleo and Whole30 diet market. The company also recently pulled in $5 million in seed funding from Echo Capital, Essential Investments and various angels to help expand its line of mercury-tested seafood products including a new line of seasoned tuna pouches using real spice blends, Ahi canned tuna and canned and pouched salmon. We started over and created a canned tuna that tastes better, looks better and is better for you, Wittenberg said. Our artisan process lets us retain 100 percent of the nutrients and natural oils in each tuna and we slow cook each one to perfection. Each Safe Catch product promises to not contain pyrophosphates or additives and is BPA-free. You can find the brand in various grocery stores or online at Amazon and other various retail outlets.\n",

      "I don t like tech conferences. I mean, of course I don t, they re not meant for people like me. I m an introvert, so I find them exhausting, and am (presumably) less likely than an extrovert to meet interesting or contributory people. I read much faster than people talk, so they re not a good way for me to learn things. But there s more to my dislike than that. I find that the actual goal of conferences often seems to be quite distinct from the notional goal. The notional goal is for people to come together to learn about the field in question: some detailed specifics, some new announcements, and an overall general view of the state of the art, all under one roof. Maybe, if all goes well, to even find people to collaborate with in the future. To the extent that conferences do those things, they re great. But at too many conferences, those intentions often seem to be incidental to the actual goal, which is to reify the importance and social status of the conference organizers and speakers, while in practice all else is secondary. Obviously this wouldn t be true, or at least wouldn t matter, if people were actually getting their money s worth from the pearls of wisdom their VIP speakers drop on stage. But are they really? Speaking as an occasional alleged pearl-of-wisdom dropper myself, let me assure you: I have serious doubts. There seems to be a widespread mindset that all you really need to succeed is insight. That you just need to learn a little more, to integrate one more dose of perspicacity from some billionaire or guru, and then you too will have assembled enough of an arsenal of wisdom to overcome any of life s or business s obstacles. That what separates success from failure is a sufficiency of sage advice. This seems to be especially common among those who revere academia, or their idea of academia. The problem is this: it s not true. Very few pearls or even paragraphs of wisdom ever actually translate into any kind of actionable plan. What s more, if you look hard you can probably find unimpeachable wisdom arguing all sides of any given situation. Meanwhile, if you re doing something genuinely interesting, then nobody really knows what the hell is going to work or not yet; and if you aren t, then a dozen others are doing it too, and execution, rather than a little extra abstruse understanding is going to make the difference. Either way, pearls of wisdom seem pretty extraneous. What does help is learning from others mistakes, when and only when the context of those mistakes is comparable to yours but it s rare for conferences to invite speakers to talk about their mistakes. Rather, VIP speakers talk about how they made it, and while doing so are incentivized by basic human nature to overstate their own contributions to their success, and understate those of external forces meaning the wisdom they re doling out is almost always heavily skewed by (frequently unconscious) self-serving bias. Far better than listening to pearls of wisdom is hearing people being challenged professionally. Again, that s rare although it does happen. It s why I like TechCrunch s conferences. (I know, I know, you re thinking of course he d say that, but it s actually true. I vote with my feet; I can get into most tech conferences for free, and almost never do, but I always attend Disrupt.) This is because of the Battlefield format, in which a clutch of startups get to introduce themselves, which is mildly interesting and then get grilled by skeptical industry experts live on-stage, which is the good bit. I also like unconferences, where you re more likely to hear war stories and learn from others mistakes, rather than be expected to sit at the feet of lionized gurus and feed on what crusts of wisdom they might choose to drop. All too many formal, paid conferences, though, are part of what I call the insight-industrial complex : people flock to them to hear quasi-famous people rattle off pseudo-wise sound bites devoid of any actual value. This applies very much to social media, too, of course. Twitter is clearly the grassroots of the insight-industrial complex. Being insightful is not actually that important. No, really. Here s an even more heretical thought: even being intelligent is not actually that important, whether you measure importance by success, happiness, or influence. What matters most is often usually execution, not wisdom; attention to detail, not vision. I m aware of the irony that most of this essay, as with most of my TC columns, is itself structured to consist of sound bites that are arguably sort of striving in at least a vaguely insightful direction. But bear in mind you re reading this for free, while conferences cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. By all means, go to them to network, to get an overview of your field, to witness people being challenged, and to learn from others mistakes. But don t go because they feature speakers from the insight-industrial complex.\n",

      "Consistent access to clean water is something billions lack, and part of that is the inability to check whether one s water is clean or not. Lishtot could help change this with a tiny device that instantly determines if water is safe to drink just by analyzing the electric field around it no strips, no microfluidics, no toxic chemicals. It honestly sounds too good to be true, but as far as I can tell it s the real thing. I talked with Lishtot (Hebrew for drink ) CEO Netanel Raisch at CES, where he demonstrated the simplicity and effectiveness of the TestDrop device. He had with him two plastic cups of water, to one of which had been added a contaminant. Pressing the test button, he moved the TestDrop toward one cup blue light, clean. Do the same for the other red light, contaminated. It s that simple to operate; I did it myself successfully after one or two tries. It s so simple, in fact, that I was suspicious. I thought it might be some kind of spectroscopy, but where was the emitter? Why did you have to move it, if not to create some kind of doppler effect? Turns out that the whole thing is based on the electromagnetic fields that surround everything. Water creates its own local field, which is measured by moving the TestDrop through it, and it turns out that clean water emits a slightly different field than water with lead or chlorine in it, water with E. coli, water with dissolved animal matter and so on. The device has been subjected to third-party testing, two reports from which I read; the thing really works. It detected even tiny amounts of lead and protein instantly and with 100 percent accuracy and no false positives or negatives. The replaceable watch battery should last for years even if you re using the device 10 or 20 times a day. Several of these known readings are built-in (it s calibrated around half a plastic cup of water, as the plastic doesn t interfere with the fields) and the TestDrop doesn t need to check its data against the cloud in order to give a drink/don t drink response. If, however, you do want to bring in the smartphone and app part, there s a service that Lishtot is running that tracks tests done with its devices, if users choose to submit them. Raisch hopes this will become a useful database both for ordinary users (who can find clean water sources if necessary) and governments or companies (who can tap in and watch for trends). You ll be able to report problems directly to the utility, as well. Lishtot has more water purity-related technology on the way, but for now the TestDrop is its main product. The devices cost $50 each, or $35 with the CES discount but my guess is they re more likely to spread when bought in bulk by NGOs, utilities and other organizations, which will then distribute them where they re most needed.\n",

      "Avro, a life sciences startup in Y Combinator s current batch, is banking on a method to deliver medications to populations unable to swallow or chew it will administer them through the skin. Starting with allergy medications, the startup is developing skin patches that release drugs commonly used in seasonal allergies for children. The patches act much like nicotine patches, which deliver nicotine to those trying to quit smoking, but can deliver a variety of drugs, such as allergy medications, through our body s largest organ. Co-founder Shakir Lakhani, who suffers from both seasonal and food allergies himself, tells TechCrunch he wanted to start with allergy relief not just for personal reasons but because it s an area where children are resistant to taking the medications already out there. There s medications that say they taste like banana but don t really taste like banana, he said. The drugs are also relatively safe so it s something we can work with without being too worried. It s also not the first company to offer transdermal drug delivery. Miami-based pharmaceutical company ProSolus creates skin patches for delivery of various generic drugs and over-the-counter products, Fremont outfit Zosano makes specialty transdermal patches for delivery of migraine-reducing medicines and Viaskin is making a patch for kids with peanut allergies though clinical trials have so far not gone well. These companies could easily start offering the same types of patches as Avro, should the startup prove the market need. One advantage is that the drugs Avro wants to use in its patches are already out there it wouldn t need to prove they work. They just need to prove the delivery method is safe and effective. But the startup has a long way to go before getting these patches into the hands of consumers. First, Avro will need FDA approval to sell in the United States and Canada, where the company plans to market its patches. To get there, it will need to conduct some human clinical trials, which Lakhani says he s in the process of looking into at the moment but believes he ll be able to get up and running in Q3 of this year. Lakhani also mentioned his skin patches could eventually offer other types of medicines. We re looking at things like people suffering from near degenerative diseases and more intense diseases that inhibit your ability to swallow, like Multiple Sclerosis, he told TechCrunch. I think those will be really interesting avenues for us to go down in the future and we re just starting to initiate conversations with other companies who might be good partners for us.\n",

      "Spotahome, a Madrid-based startup that lets you view and book mid to long-term accommodation online, has made its first acquisition after raising 13.6 million in Series A funding late last year. The proptech company has acquired international student community Erasmusu, a move that will see Spotahome add up to 70,000+ more properties to its rental inventory and gain access to what co-founder and CEO Alejandro Artacho tells me is the largest network of Erasmus students in Europe . Terms of the deal remain undisclosed, though I understand the purchase price is several million Euros (update: one source pegs it at 2 million) and was a mixture of cash and stock. Notably, Erasmusu, which was started by its founders as a side project eight years ago before becoming a leader in the space, hadn t raised VC backing and has been largely bootstrapped. In that sense, it remained ripe for the picking. Erasmusu currently claims 2 million visits per month (of which I m told 80 percent is organic), is growing 2.5x year over year, and has half a million active students who are looking for homes and, crucially, writing content for the site. It s this community building aspect, in addition to Erasmusu s lean startup achievements, that Artacho says Spotahome can learn from. In many aspects, the two startups were competitors, too. Spotahome aims to solve the problem of how to find mid to long-term accommodation online, including negating in-person viewing for the tenant. Key to this is the startup s insistence that all accommodation is vetted in-person by members of the Spotahome team. These Home checkers visit every property to create accompanying audio-visual material and to verify the listing. And whilst Erasmusu started out focused on building an online community for Erasmus students, covering various aspects of international student life, it quickly found that finding accommodation was one of its most active topics. This led the Spanish company to add classified ads for rentals, before evolving into a transactional model in 2015 pitting it against other rental marketplaces, including the much younger Spotahome. Now that the acquisition has closed, Spotahome has already begun to power the rentals aspect of Erasmusu, although the two sites and teams will remain independent. This is seeing Spotahome undergo the quite labour intensive process of creating audio-visual material (or what might be called virtual tours) for all of the accommodation listed on Erasmusu. In other words, bringing the Spotahome experience of finding a place to live to Erasmus students. In return, Spotahome supercharges not only its inventory of properties, but also the countries and cities it is now active in. The newly-formed Spotahome Group which points to more acquisitions in the not-so-distant future now offers more than 115,000 flats, houses, rooms and student residences in 450 cities across 65 countries. Artacho says the startup also has a much broader user base now with 0.5m active users and 3m visits per month, whilst the new combined entity employs over 235 staff.\n",

      "The slings and arrows of outrage keep flying at Facebook. Today a coalition of child health advocates has published an open letter addressing CEO Mark Zuckerberg and calling for the company to shutter Messenger Kids: Aka the Snapchat-ish comms app it launched in the US last December targeted at the under 13s. At the time Facebook described Messenger Kids as an easier and safer way for kids to video chat and message with family and friends when they can t be together in person and said the product had been co-developed with parents, kids and experts . The video chat and messaging app includes a child-friendly selection of augmented reality lenses, stickers and manually curated GIFs for spicing up family messaging. At launch Facebook also emphasized there were no ads or paid content downloads inside the app, and also claimed: Your child s information isn t used for ads. Though that particular message coming from a people-profiling ad giant whose business model entirely depends on encouraging usage of its products in order to harvest user data for ad targeting purposes can only hold so much water. And the company has been accused of trying to use Messenger Kids as, essentially, a gateway drug to familiarize preschoolers with its products to have a better chance of onboarding them into its ad-targeting mainstream product when they become teenagers. A study conducted by UK media watchdog Ofcom last fall has suggested that use of social media by children younger than 13 is on the rise despite social networks typically having an age limit of 13-years-old for signups. (In the EU, the incoming GDPR introduces a 13-years age-limit on kids being able to consent to use social media themselves, though Member States can choose to raise the limit to 16 years.) In practice there s little to stop kids who have access to a mobile device downloading and signing up for apps and services themselves unless their parents are actively policing their device use. (Facebook says it closes the accounts of any underage Facebook users when it s made aware of them.) And concern about the impact of social media pressures on children has been rising. Earlier this month, for example, the UK government s Children s Commissioner for England called for parents to ban their kids from using the Snapchat messaging app citing concerns over addictive features and cyber bullying. With Messenger Kids Facebook may well be spying an opportunity to try to outmanoeuvre its teen-focused rival by winning over parents with a dedicated app that bakes in parental controls. However this strategy of offering a sandboxed environment for kids to message with parentally approved contacts isn t winning over everyone. Writing now, under the banner of The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood , the coalition of around 100 child health advocates and groups describes it as particularly irresponsible of Facebook to have launched an app targeting preschoolers at a time when they say there is mounting concern about how social media use affects adolescents wellbeing . Last week, for example, a study conducted by researchers at San Diego State University found that teens who spent more time on social media, gaming, texting and video-chatting on their phones were not as happy as those who played sports, went outside and interacted with people face to face. Younger children are simply not ready to have social media accounts, the coalition argues. They are not old enough to navigate the complexities of online relationships, which often lead to misunderstandings and conflicts even among more mature users. They also do not have a fully developed understanding of privacy, including what s appropriate to share with others and who has access to their conversations, pictures, and videos. They also argue that Facebook s Messenger Kids app is likely to result in young kids spending more time using digital devices. Already, adolescents report difficulty moderating their own social media use, they write. Messenger Kids will exacerbate this problem, as the anticipation of friends responses will be a powerful incentive for children to check and stay on a phone or tablet. Encouraging kids to move their friendships online will interfere with and displace the face-to-face interactions and play that are crucial for building healthy developmental skills, including the ability to read human emotion, delay gratification, and engage with the physical world. The group goes on to rebut Facebook s claims that Messenger Kids helps brings remote families closer by pointing out that a dedicated Facebook app is not necessary for children to keep in touch with long distance relatives, and citing the plethora of alternative options that can be used for that (such as using a parents Facebook or Skype account or Apple s FaceTime or just making an old fashioned telephone call) which do not require kids to have their own account on any app. [T]he app s overall impact on families and society is likely to be negative, normalizing social media use among young children and creating peer pressure for kids to sign up for their first account, they argue, adding: Raising children in our new digital age is difficult enough. We ask that you do not use Facebook s enormous reach and influence to make it even harder. Please make a strong statement that Facebook is committed to the wellbeing of children and society by pulling the plug on Messenger Kids. Asked for a response to the group s call to close down Messenger Kids, a Facebook spokesperson sent us the following email statement reiterating its messaging around the product at the time it launched: Messenger Kids is a messaging app that helps parents and children to chat in a safer way, with parents always in control of their child s contacts and interactions. Since we launched in December we ve heard from parents around the country that Messenger Kids has helped them stay in touch with their children and has enabled their children to stay in touch with family members near and far. For example, we ve heard stories of parents working night shifts being able read bedtime stories to their children, and mums who travel for work getting daily updates from their kids while they re away. We worked to create Messenger Kids with an advisory committee of parenting and developmental experts, as well as with families themselves and in partnership with the PTA. We continue to be focused on making Messenger Kids be the best experience it can be for families. We have been very clear that there is no advertising in Messenger Kids. Discussing what evidence there is to support concerns over the development impact of digital devices on preschool children, John Oates, a senior lecturer in developmental psychology at the Open University who specializes in early childhood, told us: The difficulty is that we have very high profile anecdotal cases [of social media concern, where the specific risk is tiny vs the total volume of chats being sent] But, clearly the harm is potentially great and the real issue is balancing risks and harm. There is very little large scale evidence around actual developmental impacts on children. And I think that s a problem and it s difficult to know quite how one would research that anyway. In, to isolate cause and effect in this area is really, really difficult. Because children differentially access and use these social media because of their differing profiles let s call them personality profiles. So some children are more likely to be drawn to use social media and then some of those children are more likely to use it in negative ways, and then some of those children are more likely to be then exposed, as a result, to risk. So the cause and effect chain that s involved is very complex. Oates also points out that younger children, in the 6 to 12 years age range which Facebook Messenger Kids targets, are firstly not necessarily aware of the risks and potential harms, and secondly are also not cognitively well able to analyze, rationally, the risks and make risk-free decisions . So I think there is a difficulty around all social media in terms of children getting access to it when they re not aware of the risks. Whether they could be educated better or not is a difficult question because if they re not cognitively able to make rational, risk-based judgements it could be argued that no matter what parents do, and no matter what education does this is still risky for children, he said. The other issue he raises as being a point of discussion and concern for child psychologists is the extent to which extensive use of social media might be a problem by taking children away from other activities that may be more valuable. There is a concern there, but there again it comes back to what differences in children predisposed them to get very involved in Snapchat and other social media, Facebook, etc, he told TechCrunch. And it seems that one of the main motivations for children is a social one, to feel that they are part of a social group that they can identify with. We know that children in this age range are very sensitive to peer approval and peer disapproval. So they re often quite aware of negative messaging on social media even if they haven t experienced it, they ll know about it. Because this is very salient to them. So it s really the nature of their social nexus that they form that s probably the formative element and the messaging within that. It is a real challenge to unpick cause and effect in this area, he added. That s why answering these questions is extremely difficult. But I think what we can do, on the other hand, is we can draw tentative conclusions from what we do know about children s development [such as the strong influence of peers]. Oates also raises the potential of apps that enable children to form social networks digitally (vs only being able to do that face to face) as being a positive change for children seeing the world from a whole variety of perspectives and seeing bits of the world that they wouldn t otherwise see; seeing other children s points of views and so on and so forth . There s a lot of potential there and I wouldn t be just simply negative about this. But recognize that with anything that opens up children s worlds there are risks as well as benefits, he added.\n",

      "Algolia adds search analytics so that you can optimize your search results Algolia had made a tiny acquisition to complement its product offering. The company is acquiring the technology behind SeaUrchin.IO the team of two behind this product is not joining Algolia. For those not familiar with Algolia, the startup has developed an impressive search engine API. In just a few lines of codes, you can boost the search box on your site with Algolia s search. After that, Algolia provides instant letter-by-letter search results. It feels like you re searching for something on your local computer using Spotlight. Integrating Algolia into your website is one part, but you also need to feed Algolia with your search data and customize your data set. This is where SeaUrchin.IO s technology becomes useful. Instead of blindingly reordering your search results by setting your custom ranking rules, you get insights from Algolia s analytics feature. From the initial idea to the actual release, it took Algolia six months to release this feature. SeaUrchin.IO s acquisition was just a way to kick off the work more quickly. Now, you can tie conversion rates to queries. For instance, if you re running an e-commerce website, you see which query has a higher chance of leading to adding a product to your cart. You can track clicks and conversion events to make small changes and optimize your search flow. This way, you can fix problematic queries, tag your search results more appropriately to resurface interesting content or add synonyms. Customers with higher plans can start using the new analytics product now. A lighter version of the analytics feature might come later for smaller plans. And this is just a start as analytics opens up other opportunities. For instance, Algolia customers will be able to A/B test different relevance formulas. Eventually, you could also imagine models and recommendations based on machine learning across all Algolia customers. Algolia currently has a bit less than 5,000 customers generating over a billion searches per day. Its clients include Under Armour, Twitch, Periscope, Medium and Stripe.\n",

      "Irish startup SoapBox Labs is on a mission to create what it calls the world s most accurate and accessible speech technology for children , tech it plans to offer to third-party hardware and app developers. These span educational apps that support reading and language development, children s voice-control for IoT devices in the home, smart toys, and AR/VR experiences. Founded in 2013 by Dr. Patricia Scanlon, an ex-Bell Labs researcher and PhD with nearly 20 years experience in the area of speech recognition technologies, the young company is based on the premise that speech recognition tech built for adults, such as that most recently found in devices like the Amazon Echo or Google Home, doesn t work as well as it could do for kids. That s because children have higher pitched voices and different speech patterns. Crucially, unlike adults, younger children don t tend to adapt their speech to suit machines, either, something we do consciously or unconsciously in order to improve the utility of voice-enabled user interfaces and so-called smart assistants. In a call, Scanlon explained that when she and the SoapBox Labs team began working on this problem in 2013, they had to disregard a lot of what they already understood about how to build speech technology. After an extensive research phase, it became clear that children s speech behaviours are vastly different to adults, particularly the younger the child. Speech recognition tech developed using adult voice data that models adult behaviours leads to poor performance when used by young kids. Instead, SoapBox Labs has created its own unique children s speech dataset (consisting of thousands of hours of children s speech data), and combined this with the team s understanding of children s voice and behaviours. The resulting platform is said to leverage deep learning (AI) techniques to power the startup s proprietary models and scoring algorithms, and ultimately provide far better speech technology targeted at children. This has seen SoapBox Labs release a version of its English language children s speech recognition API for use by third parties, whilst I m told a number of partnerships are to be announced as early as next month. The company is also disclosing further funding: 2.1 million, capital it plans to use to add multiple languages to its speech recognition platform. The cash injection consists of a 1.5 million EU grant, and 600,000 from existing backers. It brings total funding for SoapBox Labs to just over 3 million. Discussing the future of children s speech recognition tech, Scanlon tells me she can see a situation where devices will recognise if it is a child or adult speaking and switch underlying data sets and models accordingly. That s because, she says, kids speech tech, whilst arguably harder to develop, doesn t work any better with adults. For now, two separate solutions are optimum. Additionally, a device or app that knows it is interacting with a child could change its behaviour or interaction permissions. In some situations, you really wouldn t want a child to be in control, however well they are understood.\n",

      "Searching for a new job can be a daunting process especially if you aren t sure what you re great at and even finding the right companies and what jobs are out there is probably enough to make you freeze for a second. Leap.ai, an intelligent recruiting platform, is looking to make life a little easier for those job seekers. The company is today launching what it s calling Instant Match, a tool that will match up potential job seekers that upload their resume with the companies that are based in their database. With a few extra questions, those job seekers can refine those options down further, and the goal is to find what the employee wants to do not just what s on their resume. Initially launched looking to use AI to guarantee interviews for job seekers in tech, co-founder Yunkai Zhou now wants to make it as easy as an instant booking on Airbnb. Right now, for a job seeker, there s two things you do: You go to job boards, and once you go there, you put in a keyword and it returns 2,000 jobs, Zhou said. It takes you a very long time to figure out what works. We really believe the right AI tech to apply to this experience is to understand the user really well and give them the job matching results right away. We ve seen this instant gratification work in other domains, it actually changes user behavior. This is a classic problem for both job seekers and recruiters. A recruiter might get a ping from a company looking to hire a head of product with a laundry list of requirements, or that job just ends up on a job board somewhere on the Internet like Indeed. A user trying to figure out what they like is then going to browse those boards, see an interesting role, and then probably see said laundry list and find that their resum doesn t match up. An application might go through, but at the end of the day, job seekers without a soft intro really only have a cover letter and a resum to work with. Now Leap.ai is trying to cut out all of that and do what essentially seems like a robust soft intro, which can infer what skills a person has and what they re good at something that probably requires an explanation in person, over the phone, or over some long email thread. But since companies sometimes are combing through hundreds of resumes, job seekers won t necessarily get a chance to show what they re good at without those referrals. Leap.ai looks to use a base of data to try to figure out what someone is good at, figure out what skills a job actually needs, and then match the two. A human is actually really a complicated entity, Zhou said. But for a human to find this matching job, it s about a lot more than just the resume or the text in the job description. A human is a lot richer than just a bunch of text on the resume. Every company actually has their hiring criteria that s not necessarily on the job description. Your description has most likely been copy-pasted. But the really hiring criteria is very dynamic and something that the recruiting team have a much better idea in their heads that doesn t translate to the job description. Leap.ai looks at a user s profile either through that resume or through some additional information from questions and tries to figure out what Zhou says are their strengths, passions, and preferences, and then figures out which companies align with that. For example, someone who s great at Python might not be listing some additional skills on their resume (or may be able to quickly learn them), ones that would easily fit a job description. Leap.ai s job is to figure out what employees fall under what clusters, which distills into a rich language problem where the company can figure out where an incoming user actually sits on a graph of skills and wants compared to where they think they are. For now, it s still a complex problem that requires a lot of information even if the company can quickly find a match right away. But as the company collects more and more data, it may be able to start automatically ferreting out what a person s true skill level is and where to get them an interview. Trying to interpret that is a complex problem of both language and a collection of rich, useful data that Leap.ai has worked to collect over time in order to figure out who should go where. And by offering a tool like instant match, it may indeed get more and more information and curious users go to Leap.ai in order to see what s out there where they may fit. We use their resume and from their resume and user experience, either from school projects, we can understand what they re good at, Zhou said. We ask them to do a self-assessment of strengths and top skills. We also ask their peers to get feedback from them. From those peers they can give the answer to top strengths and top scores. The top strengths and skills, combined together, we have a pretty good understanding of this person s real raw strength. There is, of course, a lot of competition in the put stuff in here and let s find a job space. There are companies like Hired, which require a more robust amount of information but will then review what you send in and try to figure out where to put you. LinkedIn also has collected a treasure trove of data from its hundreds of millions of users that it could begin leaning on for a similar type of product. But the hope is, as experience dealing with the same processes at Google, the company can build a sophisticated enough set of tools and get users excited enough that it ll be able to make those matches (and get those interviews) faster than anything else on the market.\n",

      "Meet Bubblz, a French startup that wants to optimize all the boring processes that slow you down. If you re trying to hire someone, if you need to collect information from many people, if you regularly put together marketing campaigns, you can use Bubblz to automate all the steps and collaborate with your coworkers. Many people use Trello or another kanban-based tool to manage potential new hires and all sorts of processes that require multiple steps. Bubblz uses the same metaphor but with a few extra tricks. Setting up a process is going to take some thinking and a bit of time. But the idea is that you ll save a lot of time once you have created a process in Bubblz. Each step is represented as a column. You can then configure some actions based on each step. For instance, if you re trying to hire someone, your first step could be an online form to collect information and upload files. After that, you can review each application and configure multiple buttons. If you click yes, it can move the application to the next column. If you click no, it can send a rejection email and archive the application. If you decide to hire someone, you can track that the person has signed their contract or automatically send an email to the IT department to make them aware of the new hire. You can define a short todo list for each step. This is just an example but you can use Bubblz for other painful processes. You can create a new process from scratch or import one from the process library. I don t think it makes sense to use Bubblz for everything, but it s the kind of services that can make sense for some very specific issues and departments. Bubblz uses a software-as-a-service approach. You can create a basic account for free, and the company also offers paid monthly plans for advanced features.\n",

      "I don t like tech conferences. I mean, of course I don t, they re not meant for people like me. I m an introvert, so I find them exhausting, and am (presumably) less likely than an extrovert to meet interesting or contributory people. I read much faster than people talk, so they re not a good way for me to learn things. But there s more to my dislike than that. I find that the actual goal of conferences often seems to be quite distinct from the notional goal. The notional goal is for people to come together to learn about the field in question: some detailed specifics, some new announcements, and an overall general view of the state of the art, all under one roof. Maybe, if all goes well, to even find people to collaborate with in the future. To the extent that conferences do those things, they re great. But at too many conferences, those intentions often seem to be incidental to the actual goal, which is to reify the importance and social status of the conference organizers and speakers, while in practice all else is secondary. Obviously this wouldn t be true, or at least wouldn t matter, if people were actually getting their money s worth from the pearls of wisdom their VIP speakers drop on stage. But are they really? Speaking as an occasional alleged pearl-of-wisdom dropper myself, let me assure you: I have serious doubts. There seems to be a widespread mindset that all you really need to succeed is insight. That you just need to learn a little more, to integrate one more dose of perspicacity from some billionaire or guru, and then you too will have assembled enough of an arsenal of wisdom to overcome any of life s or business s obstacles. That what separates success from failure is a sufficiency of sage advice. This seems to be especially common among those who revere academia, or their idea of academia. The problem is this: it s not true. Very few pearls or even paragraphs of wisdom ever actually translate into any kind of actionable plan. What s more, if you look hard you can probably find unimpeachable wisdom arguing all sides of any given situation. Meanwhile, if you re doing something genuinely interesting, then nobody really knows what the hell is going to work or not yet; and if you aren t, then a dozen others are doing it too, and execution, rather than a little extra abstruse understanding is going to make the difference. Either way, pearls of wisdom seem pretty extraneous. What does help is learning from others mistakes, when and only when the context of those mistakes is comparable to yours but it s rare for conferences to invite speakers to talk about their mistakes. Rather, VIP speakers talk about how they made it, and while doing so are incentivized by basic human nature to overstate their own contributions to their success, and understate those of external forces meaning the wisdom they re doling out is almost always heavily skewed by (frequently unconscious) self-serving bias. Far better than listening to pearls of wisdom is hearing people being challenged professionally. Again, that s rare although it does happen. It s why I like TechCrunch s conferences. (I know, I know, you re thinking of course he d say that, but it s actually true. I vote with my feet; I can get into most tech conferences for free, and almost never do, but I always attend Disrupt.) This is because of the Battlefield format, in which a clutch of startups get to introduce themselves, which is mildly interesting and then get grilled by skeptical industry experts live on-stage, which is the good bit. I also like unconferences, where you re more likely to hear war stories and learn from others mistakes, rather than be expected to sit at the feet of lionized gurus and feed on what crusts of wisdom they might choose to drop. All too many formal, paid conferences, though, are part of what I call the insight-industrial complex : people flock to them to hear quasi-famous people rattle off pseudo-wise sound bites devoid of any actual value. This applies very much to social media, too, of course. Twitter is clearly the grassroots of the insight-industrial complex. Being insightful is not actually that important. No, really. Here s an even more heretical thought: even being intelligent is not actually that important, whether you measure importance by success, happiness, or influence. What matters most is often usually execution, not wisdom; attention to detail, not vision. I m aware of the irony that most of this essay, as with most of my TC columns, is itself structured to consist of sound bites that are arguably sort of striving in at least a vaguely insightful direction. But bear in mind you re reading this for free, while conferences cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. By all means, go to them to network, to get an overview of your field, to witness people being challenged, and to learn from others mistakes. But don t go because they feature speakers from the insight-industrial complex.\n",

Twilio has also invested grant money in the International Rescue Committee, MindRight and Caravan Studios. Last year, Twilio awarded over $1.5 million in impact funds and plans to award an additional $1.5 million by the end of this year. Edovo works with facilities to bring in secure wireless networks and tablets that access Edovo s educational platform. The incentive-based learning program covers a variety of areas, including literacy, college course work, cognitive behavioral therapy and vocational training. Upon completion of certain lessons, incarcerated individuals can receive certificates and entertainment options. They can also use Edovo to stay in touch with their loved ones. Right now, Edovo is operating in 20 states in over 50 facilities. To date, over 50,000 people have accessed Edovo s educational content. This is government, so there are limitations and challenges to operating with government, Edovo co-founder Brian Hill told TechCrunch. As an impact entrepreneur, it s on us to innovate and figure out how to make it easy to work with challenging organizations. On average, those who participate in correctional education programs had 43 percent lower chances of returning to prison than those who did not participate in education programs, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Our goal is to make sure everyone incarcerated has free access to education on a daily basis, Hill said. By the end of 2018, Edovo plans to be in all but five states. Another goal is to open up the channel of communication between loved ones and the incarcerated person, Hill said. Ultimately, Edovo s 2018 is about creating accessible communications, driving mental health treatment successfully through technology and identifying specifically what drives change in an individual.

      "Wonderschool, a network of in-home daycare and preschools, plans to open 150 programs in New York City after raising $2.1 million in new funding. The capital comes from non-profit investment firm Omidyar Network, Be Curious Partners, Rethink Education, Edelweiss Partners and Learn Capital and brings the startup s total raised so far to more than $4 million, including a seed round announced last summer. Headquartered in San Francisco, most of Wonderschool s programs, or about 140, are in the Bay Area and Los Angeles. The startup already has 16 programs in New York City, which suffers from a huge childcare shortage exacerbated by some of the highest tuition rates in the country. Wonderschool s general manager there is Ben Newton, who was on the founding team of Avenues: The World School, an international system of private schools. One of the reasons Wonderschool was created is because compensation rates in early childcare education are so low that many caregivers are not only priced out of the neighborhoods they serve, but eventually quit the field (sometimes because they, ironically, cannot afford childcare costs for their own kids on their salaries). Part of Wonderschool s value proposition for providers, which it screens based on credentials, experience and education, is efficiency. It not only provides its programs with support, but also helps them with licensing, creating a daily routine for kids, maintaining liability insurance, meeting health and safety standards and other time-consuming administrative tasks. The company s tech platform lets carers manage their programs, communicate with parents and take payments online, while giving parents program, enrollment and tuition information. Wonderschool emphasizes in-home programs because it helps providers save further on costs (and lets them look after their own children, too) and monetizes by taking a percentage of monthly tuition fees. In a statement, Isabelle Hau, the U.S. education lead at Omidyar Network, said Wonderschool is responding with better quality and more flexible solutions to meet the needs of early learners, their parents and child care providers. By using Wonderschool s technology platform, early learning educators get to focus on what they are best at, which is caring for and teaching young children. Wonderschool founder and chief executive officer Chris Bennett says city leaders have contacted the startup about launching in their communities, but it will focus first on growing its network in California and New York City. Since we do build up waiting lists for programs that we support, it has been more of a focus to build density in areas where we already support programs, rather than starting in new areas, so that we can support the families that have already come to Wonderschool to find a program for their child, he told TechCrunch.

      "If members of the European Parliament thought they could bring Mark Zuckerberg to heel with his recent appearance, they underestimated the enormous gulf between 21st century companies and their last-century regulators. Zuckerberg himself reiterated that regulation is necessary, provided it is the right regulation. But anyone who thinks that our existing regulatory tools can reign in our digital behemoths is engaging in magical thinking. Getting to right regulation will require us to think very differently. The challenge goes far beyond Facebook and other social media: the use and abuse of data is going to be the defining feature of just about every company on the planet as we enter the age of machine learning and autonomous systems. So far, Europe has taken a much more aggressive regulatory approach than anything the US was contemplating before or since Zuckerberg s testimony. The European Parliament s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is now in force, which extends data privacy rights to all European citizens regardless of whether their data is processed by companies within the EU or beyond. But I m not holding my breath that the GDPR will get us very far on the massive regulatory challenge we face. It is just more of the same when it comes to regulation in the modern economy: a lot of ambiguous costly-to-interpret words and procedures on paper that are outmatched by rapidly evolving digital global technologies. Crucially, the GDPR still relies heavily on the outmoded technology of user choice and consent, the main result of which has seen almost everyone in Europe (and beyond) inundated with emails asking them to reconfirm permission to keep their data. But this is an illusion of choice, just as it is when we are ostensibly given the option to decide whether to agree to terms set by large corporations in standardized take-it-or-leave-it click-to-agree documents. There s also the problem of actually tracking whether companies are complying. It is likely that the regulation of online activity requires yet more technology, such as blockchain and AI-powered monitoring systems, to track data usage and implement smart contract terms. As the EU has already discovered with the right to be forgotten, however, governments lack the technological resources needed to enforce these rights. Search engines are required to serve as their own judge and jury in the first instance; Google at last count was doing 500 a day. The fundamental challenge we face, here and throughout the modern economy, is not: what should the rules for Facebook be? but rather, how can we can innovate new ways to regulate effectively in the global digital age? The answer is that we need to find ways to harness the same ingenuity and drive that built Facebook to build the regulatory systems of the digital age. One way to do this is with what I call super-regulation which involves developing a market for licensed private regulators that serve two masters: achieving regulatory targets set by governments but also facing the market incentive to compete for business by innovating more cost-effective ways to do that. Imagine, for example, if instead of drafting a detailed 261-page law like the EU did, a government instead settled on the principles of data protection, based on core values, such as privacy and user control. Private entities, profit and non-profit, could apply to a government oversight agency for a license to provide data regulatory services to companies like Facebook, showing that their regulatory approach is effective in achieving these legislative principles. These private regulators might use technology, big-data analysis, and machine learning to do that. They might also figure out how to communicate simple options to people, in the same way that the developers of our smartphone figured that out. They might develop effective schemes to audit and test whether their systems are working on pain of losing their license to regulate. There could be many such regulators among which both consumers and Facebook could choose: some could even specialize in offering packages of data management attributes that would appeal to certain demographics – from the people who want to be invisible online, to those who want their every move documented on social media. The key here is competition: for-profit and non-profit private regulators compete to attract money and brains the problem of how to regulate complex systems like data creation and processing. Zuckerberg thinks there s some kind of right regulation possible for the digital world. I believe him; I just don t think governments alone can invent it. Ideally, some next generation college kid would be staying up late trying to invent it in his or her dorm room. The challenge we face is not how to get governments to write better laws; it s how to get them to create the right conditions for the continued innovation necessary for new and effective regulatory systems.\n",

      "Apple has a long legacy of providing services to schools and teachers, but the industry has shifted in recent years as the Chromebook has completely changed the way classrooms work. The company is no doubt looking to take back some of that mindshare. This morning, it sent out invites for an event, asking attendees to, “take a field trip.” The event, which is slated for the Chicago-area March 27, promises to offer “creative new ideas.” Is it a hardware launch? Perhaps something akin to the event Microsoft held roughly this time last year, where it launched Windows 10 S and the new Surface Laptop? The iPad has long been the centerpiece of Apple’s education strategy, so it seems like a safe bet that we’ll be seeing something related to that line. In fact, the educational element has been baked into the product’s pitch since launch. While the tablet market hasn’t exactly been catching the world on fire of late (in fact, it’s been declining), Apple’s slate is still a bright spot in the declining category. The iPad certainly seems ready for a refresh, and rumors have been arriving from all sorts of strange places pointing to new devices on the way. Of course, even if new hardware does arrive, the event will no doubt be about more than just devices. Apple’s been showcasing some interesting software solutions that help give educators and school IT departments more control over individual tablets, along with a new slate of educational apps. Likely the company with showcase products in the hands of students and make the case for why its premium offerings are ultimately the better solution than the Chromebooks that have flooded the educational market in recent years — and for that matter, those $289 Windows S laptops. Apple could have chosen any day to announce the event, of course. Surely it’s just a coincidence that the invites dropped the same day Samsung’s latest flagship hits the market, right?\n",

      "If you want to learn how to build flying cars, then your options in terms of getting an education are kind of limited. Enter Udacity, the online education platform founded by Google self-driving car pioneer Sebastian Thrun. It s now accepting applications for its Flying Car Nanodegree program, which it announced last year along with a new Introduction to Self-Driving engineering course. The Flying Car Nanodegree is partly exactly what it sounds like, but in an interview Thrun admitted that the name is designed to ignite the pop culture imagination in addition to describing what you ll get out of the program. For one, the car designation for most flying vehicles isn t entirely accurate, Thrun said in an interview but the term does make sense in terms of explaining the opportunity represented by personal aerial transportation craft. While most people don t see this as a reality yet, that your pizza gets flown in by drone, it would be a complete game-changer if your local store, your local Target, your local Walmart, would be able to deliver groceries to you via drones, Thrun said. The same is true for people transportation, and I really believe that we re going to have a future at some point where everybody will fly every day[ ] that realization, I predict will happen in the next few years. Course instructors for the Flying Car Nanodegree program include Thrun himself, who also has a startup dedicated to making personal aerial vehicles a reality (Kitty Hawk); as well as University of Toronto aerial robotics Professor Angela Schoellig; Kiva Systems founder and ETH Zurich Professor Raffaello D Andrea; and MIT Professor and Google Project Wing founder Nicholas Roy. Thrun explained that while students can get component skills for building future autonomous aerial transportation vehicles, it s currently very difficult to put together all the pieces into something comprehensive and specific to the field. It ends up being tremendously cross-disciplinary, and that s where Udacity s strengths at identifying very specific needs and building appropriate educational courses comes into play. And even if in the immediate term it doesn t look like any kind of flying car deployment will be a significantly meaningful part of anyone s revenue picture, Thrun says we shouldn t underestimate its potential impact, and its immediate importance to companies that are taking it seriously, including Amazon, Google and others. In fact, the Udacity CEO even believes that autonomous aerial vehicles will one day eclipse self-driving cars in terms of their importance in daily urban transportation. The most revolutionary vision of a self-driving car would be the ride sharing perspective, the one that Google and Uber has been working on, where an empty car comes to you, Thrun said. You d probably cut the transportation costs of the American household in half with this ride sharing mobility service but it only works without a driver inside. So Uber costs about $1.10 per mile, and if you drive a car yourself you spend about $0.60 per mile. You can, without too much work, get this down to about $0.30 per mile if the car comes to you unmanned. With a slight leap, if it comes to you and lifts you up in the air and drops you off somewhere else, you can reach the same economics but without the [traffic] congestion. Udacity s application process closes on February 7, and Self-Driving Car Engineers and Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program students, as well as graduates of Udacity s Intro to Self-Driving Cars, will be guaranteed admission and the chance to enroll. Thrun says Udacity learned early on in its existence to responsibly gate admission so students don t encounter material beyond their competence level, and the skills developed in those programs should equip applicants well to succeed here, too. Udacity is making access to the nanodegree s curriculum and two of its full courses available to prospective students, and the full program will occupy two 12-week terms with $1,200 in tuition due for each. During the first term, students will work on Udacity s customers flight simulator on flight planning and control, and then in the second, they ll focus on coordinating flight among various autonomous systems and eventually build a virtual flying city to put all the pieces together.\n",

      "The classic problem of how teachers should devote resources to their students, such as helping students that are struggling in specific areas, is one that s still ever-present but it needs a deceptively-simple approach to making that more manageable, even if it s just a colored progress bar if Clever CEO Tyler Bosmeny gets his way. That s why Clever, a portal for educational tech tools that helps students and teachers log in and keep track of those tools, is looking to try to make that work by rolling out Clever Goals. It s a tool that, in a way, boils down to a colored progress bar that helps give teachers and students a set of near-term goals that they might want to achieve by the end of the week, and gives teachers a way to identify where to invest their time in order to help achieve those goals. Clever researched usage from its apps across teachers, students, and even the wants of parents, and ended up with a kind of easy-to-use progress report in order to keep a constant tab on how students are doing. We re focusing on marking it smarter for teachers in the classroom, Bosmeny said. You can an imagine if you re a teacher, each one of 20 students are using different apps to learn, and you need to track how students are progressing across all the apps they use. All this data, it should be making things easier, but instead, it s making it harder. It brings together all the usage data for all edtech products a teacher might be using in order to make it really easy for them to see all the usage that s happening and set weekly goals and accomplish different things. As a student, instead of seeing the icons you would see in a portal, you ll now see weekly progress bars. Those bars correspond to whatever goals a teacher has set maybe doing a half hour of practice in a literacy app or reading, or something along those lines. The aim is to set near-term reachable goals and give them a set of cues that show them how close they are to completing those near-term goals. Teachers then get an overview of which where students are on their goals within each segment. That gives them an idea of areas where their students need to catch up and where they are progressing quickly, helping them tune their curriculum or working with specific students that might need help on certain subjects. For teachers whose students are working through several different education tech problems, that gives them an opportunity to quickly see where to focus their efforts. Part of the reason the actual product itself seems so simple is that it needed to be able to deliver actionable information in bite-sized bits for time-starved teachers and resources. That could simply boil down to the whole red-yellow-green look of a progress bar, but it s that kind of way of delivering information that helps display a wealth of raw data in a palatable instead of a massive grid of spreadsheets or something along those lines. We worked pretty closely with a lot of districts, Bosmeny said. Many agreed to buy this product before it was even built. Everyone is struggling with this problem of data in this world where all this software is being used in the classroom. We built this hand-in-hand with districts, they see the need, and districts have been using this as we ve been testing it. Another small change, he said, was that the company found that there was a lot of engagement through an email update on progress compared to through the web portal. Again, it came down to coming to work with teachers on their terms listening to their needs, a common theme among the general software world but one that increasingly needs to be applied to education. A push instead of a pull has been really effective, he said. Once students can get access to the software, now we can talk about using it smartly and effectively, he said. Two years ago, this wouldn t have made any sense because the access problem wouldn t have been solved. Teachers were struggling with 20 usernames and passwords. A very high-tech analytics goal-setting mechanism would ve never gotten off the ground. We believe edtech has gotten to a state of maturity where schools are buying lots of software that s proving to help kids learn if they use it in the right ways. To be sure, there will be plenty of challenges to getting this into the hands of schools. Bosmeny said the company has worked with plenty of districts, but cracking edtech is a notoriously hard problem, and there are a lot of different interpretations of the progress report (such as tools to deliver better feedback like Peergrade). But the goal is to replace that bi-semester piece of paper with something more robust, and Bosmeny thinks that is the way to get more teachers and students on board.

      "ELSA, an app whose name stands for English Language Speech Assistant (and not the popular Disney character!), has raised $3.2 million for its A.I.-assisted language learning platform that teaches people how to speak English. Unlike other courses that focus mainly on teaching grammar and vocabulary, ELSA uses artificial intelligence and speech recognition technology to help language learners with their pronunciation. The $3.2 million pre-A round of funding was led by Monk s Hill Ventures, a firm that invests in post-seed stage startups in Southeast Asia. Monk s Hill founder and partner, Peng T. Ong, is joining ELSA s board. The San Francisco-based startup was originally founded in 2015 by Stanford grad Vu Van, ELSA CEO, and Dr. Xavier Anguera, whose background is in speech recognition and A.I. technologies. It debuted at SXSW in March 2016, where it later won the SXSWedu launch competition. According to Van, who was born and raised in Vietnam, the idea for ELSA was prompted by her personal experience in trying to learn English. I moved to the States for my MBA and Master s in Education at Stanford, she says. My first year at Stanford was very challenging because of my ability to speak English. A lot of the time, people misunderstood me, Van continues. Although ELSA s founder was able to write and read English fairly well, she wanted to find a good solution for improving her accent and she came up short. I realized that people didn t really have a lot of solutions when it comes to speaking, they could either go to a speech therapist that costs them $150 an hour, who could listen to them and fix their pronunciation, or they could go to YouTube or watch Netflix, which is a one-way learning solution, Van says. She decided to develop ELSA as a result of her own struggles, bringing in co-founder Dr. Anguera to help create ELSA s proprietary speech recognition technology. To use ELSA, language learners download the app for iOS or Android, then take ELSA s five-minute assessment test which identifies the user s pronunciation proficiency and identifies where they still have challenges. This information is then used to build out a personalized curriculum, tailored to the user s current abilities. In ELSA, there are around 600 lessons and 3,000+ words across a variety of topics, like introductions, talking about family or relationships, jobs and hiring, traveling, and more. The app is also updated regularly with seasonal and timely topics, like lessons featuring the holidays, or even the new Star Wars movie, so learners can better participate in everyday communication. The lessons themselves are bite-sized, at 2 minutes long. They have five exercises that get progressively harder, including pronunciations of words, phrases and sentences. ELSA works by listening to learners voices, then matching up what they said with the correct American English pronunciation. The words on the screen are highlighted in red, yellow and green to show how well each the student did. The app will also help by making suggestions as to how the speaker can improve on a given sound for example, by telling them how to shape their mouth or move their tongue. Behind the scenes, ELSA is powered by A.I. technology, that listens to users speech something the team built from scratch. The speech recognition technology out there is slightly different [from ELSA]. They try to guess what you re saying, whether you re saying it right or wrong. It s obviously very forgiving to mistakes. What we want to do is the exact opposite, says Van. Since its launch two years ago, ELSA has been adopted by a few million users in over 100 countries, with around half its user base in Southeast Asia, and the rest spread out elsewhere in the world, including in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Users are today practicing a few million exercises per week. progress assessment topic view skill view 2 skill view feedback for conversation dictionary WordFeedbackScreen View Slideshow Previous Next Exit With the additional funding, ELSA is planning to address the requests from teachers who want to use the service in their classrooms by developing a tool that will let them enter words and phrases from own curriculum. It s also going to begin the work to add new languages to the platform, and build out its voice recognition API. ELSA today generates revenue through subscriptions, priced at $3.99/month or $29.99/year. A quarterly option is available as well, though prices may vary by region. While the product for teachers will be affordable, it won t be free potentially offering another revenue stream. The company will also use the funds to hire additional A.I. talent, says Vu. ELSA s app is a free download on iOS and Android.\n",

      "As an education investor, one of my favorite sayings is that education is the next industry to be disrupted by technology, and has been for the past twenty years. When I started my career at Warburg Pincus, I inherited a portfolio of technology companies that senior partners naively believed would solve major problems in our education system. It would have worked out fine, of course, except for all the people. Teachers weren t always interested in changing the way they taught. IT staff weren t always capable of implementing new technologies. And schools weren t always 100% rational in their purchasing decisions. And so while, given the size of the market, projections inexorably led to $100M companies, sales cycles stretched asymptotically and deals never seemed to close, particularly in K-12 education. My current firm, University Ventures, began life in 2011 with the goal of funding the next wave of innovation in higher education. Much of our early work did revolve around technology, such as backing companies that helped universities develop and deploy online degree programs. But it turned out that in making traditional degree programs more accessible, we weren t addressing the fundamental problem. At the time, America was in the process of recovering from the Great Recession, and it was clear that students were facing twin crises of college affordability and post-college employability. The fundamental problem we needed to solve was to help individuals traverse from point A to point B, where point B is a good first job or a better job in a growing sector of the economy. Once we embarked on this journey, we figured out that the education-to-employment missing link was in the last mile and conceptualized last-mile training as the logical bridge over the skills gap. Last-mile training has two distinct elements. The first is training on the digital skills that traditional postsecondary institutions aren t addressing, and that are increasingly listed in job descriptions across all sectors of the economy (and particularly for entry-level jobs). This digital training can be as extensive as coding, or as minimal as becoming proficient on a SaaS platform utilized for a horizontal function (e.g., Salesforce CRM) or for a particular role in an industry vertical. The second is reducing friction on both sides of the human capital equation: friction that might impede candidates from getting the requisite last-mile training (education friction), and friction on the employer side that reduces the likelihood of hire (hiring friction). Successful last-mile models absorb education and hiring friction away from candidates and employers, eliminating tuition and guaranteeing employment outcomes for candidates, while typically providing employers with the opportunity to evaluate candidates work before making hiring decisions. Today we have eight portfolio companies that take on risk themselves in order to reduce friction for candidates and employers. The first clearly viable last-mile training model is the combination with staffing. Staffing companies are a promising investment target for our broadened focus because they have their finger on the pulse of the talent needs of their clients. Moreover, staffing in the U.S. is a $150B industry consisting of profitable companies looking to move up the value chain with higher margin, differentiated products. Because fill rates on job reqs can be as low as 20% in some skill gap areas of technology and health care, there is no question that differentiation is required; many companies view staffing vendors as commodities because they continue to fish in the same small pool of talent, often serving up the exact same talent as competitors in response to reqs. Adding last-mile training to staffing not only frees the supply of talent by providing purpose-trained, job-ready, inexpensive talent at scale, but also increases margins and accelerates growth. It is this potential that has prompted staffing market leader Adecco (market cap ~$12B) to acquire coding bootcamp leader General Assembly for $412.5M. The acquisition launches Adecco down a promising new growth vector combining last-mile training and staffing. We believe that staffing is only the most obvious last-mile training model. Witness the rise of pathways to employment like Education at Work. Owned by the not-for-profit Strada Education Network, Education at Work operates call centers on the campuses of universities like University of Utah and Arizona State for the express purpose of providing last-mile training to students in sales and customer support roles. Clients can then hire proven talent once students graduate. Education at Work has hired over 2,000 students into its call centers since its inception in 2012. Education at Work is the earliest example of what we call outsourced apprenticeships. For years policy makers have taken expensive junkets to Germany and Switzerland to view their vaunted apprenticeship models ones we ll never be able to replicate here for about a hundred different reasons. This week, Ivanka Trump s Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion submitted a report to the President with a roadmap for a new and more flexible apprenticeship model, but no clear or compelling vision for scaling apprenticeships in America. Outsourced apprenticeships are a uniquely American model for apprenticeships, where service providers like call centers, marketing firms, software development shops and others decide to differentiate not only based on services, but also based on provision of purpose-trained entry-level talent. Unlike traditional apprenticeship models, employers don t need to worry about bringing apprentices on-site and managing them; in these models, apprentices sit at the service provider doing client work, proving their ability to do the job, reducing hiring friction with every passing day until they re hired by clients. America leads the world in many areas and outsourcing is one of them. Outsourced apprenticeships are an opportunity for America to leapfrog into leadership in alternative pathways to good jobs. All it will take is service providers to recognize that clients will welcome and pay for the additional value of talent provision. We foresee such models emerging across a range of industries and intend to invest in companies ideally positioned to launch them. All of these next generation last-mile training businesses will deliver education and training predominantly technical/digital training as well as soft-skills where employers also see a major gap. They ll also be highly driven by technology; technology will be utilized to source, assess and screen talent increasingly via methods that resemble science fiction more than traditional HR practices as well as to match talent to employers and positions. But they re not EdTech businesses as much as they are full-stack solutions for both candidates and employers: candidates receive guaranteed pathways to employment that are not only free they re paid to do it; and employers are able to ascertain talent and fit before hiring. While last-mile solutions can help alleviate the student loan debt and underemployment plaguing Millennials (and which put Gen Z in similar peril), they also have the potential to serve two other important social purposes. The first is diversity. Just as last-mile providers have their finger on the pulse of the skill needs of their clients, they can do the same for other needs, like diversity. Last-mile providers are sourcing and launching cohorts that directly address skill needs, as well as diversity needs. The second is retraining and reskilling of older, displaced workers. For generations, college classrooms were the sole option provided to such workers. But we re unlikely to engage those workers in greatest need of reskilling if college classrooms environments where they were previously unsuccessful are the sole, or even initial modality. As last-mile training models are in simulated or actual workplaces, they are much more accessible to displaced workers. Finally, the emergence of last-mile full-stack solutions like outsourced apprenticeships raises the question of whether enterprises might not only seek to outsource entry-level hiring, but all hiring. Why even hire an experienced worker from outside the company if there s an intermediary willing to source, assess and screen, upskill, match, and provide workers on a no-risk trial basis? As sourcing, screening, skill-building, and matching technologies become more advanced, why not offload the risk of a bad hire to an outsourced talent partner? Most employers would willingly pay a premium to reduce the risk of bad hires, or even mediocre hires. If the market does evolve in this direction, education investors with a full-stack focus have the potential to create value in every sector of the economy, making traditional investment categories of edtech seem not only na ve, but also quaint.\n",

      "Developer bootcamps several-month training programs that are designed to help people get up to speed with the technical skills they need to become a developer exploded in popularity in the early part of the decade, but there’s been a bit of a shakedown on the space recently. And that could be a product of a lot of things, but for Jacob Hess and Terry Kim, it’s just not enough time to become a fully-fledged developer. With training in the Air Force, where both had to work on these kinds of compressed programs for entry-level technicians, both decided to try their own approach. The end result is NexGenT, which is own kind of bootcamp but it’s for getting a certificate in network management, and not a one-size-fits-all sticker as a developer. That approach, which includes a 16-week class, is considerably more reasonable and helps get people industry-ready with a skill that’s teachable in that compressed period of time, Hess says. The company is launching out of Y Combinator’s winter class this year. “There are 500,000 open IT jobs, but when you look at that number, what’s more interesting is so many of them are IT operation roles, and the remaining is software development,” Hess said. “The bigger pie in IT is non-software programming jobs. Cyber security is also huge because of the automation and AI. We want to create the stepping stone. Network engineering becomes a foundation for a lot of these jobs, whether you want to be a cloud architect and work for Amazon, it all starts with understanding and building a foundation around networking.” The end result is a 16-week program where a batch of applicants gets a review, and a percentage of them are accepted into a cohort of students. They go through an engineering module, which teaches them the basics and mechanics of network engineering and learn about the IT industry. Students can go faster if they want it’s primarily online and then start working on labs where they are building their own lab, either physical or virtual. The process culminates in a project where the students have to roll out an HQ facility in two branch offices from design to technically implementing it. The next phase is about getting them certifications for various technologies, which help them basically show that they are ready to start entering the workforce. Think of it as something similar to having a Github account where prospective employers can review the work, except the process is a lot more formalized and you end up with something concrete on the resume. The final phase is around career coaching and helping them get a job, which can last up to 6 months. Throughout this process, students have access to a mentor and live coaching where students can ask whatever questions they wish. So, the process is not so dissimilar from the notion of a developer bootcamp. But at the same time, there’s a small-ish graveyard of developer bootcamps and some with issues. Galvanize in August said it would lay off around 11% of its staff, while Dev Bootcamp and Iron Yard shut down altogether. The knock on these camps is it’s hard to get developers ready to start shipping code in such a small period of time but Kim argues that getting them certified and ready to be a network engineer is definitely something that’s doable in around 16 weeks. “It’s more realistic,” Kim said. “For coding bootcamps, you have to go by off the portfolios and check their Github, and they have to pass that technical interview. In our world of IT operations, it’s not about the bachelor’s degree, it’s about the person having the knowledge. But the industry certifications come from third parties, and when they come out of our program and have two or three certifications. It’s enough to get into that entry-level job.” It remains to be seen if this kind of an approach is going to work. NexGenT charges a tuition around $12,000, which with maximum discounts hits around $6,500. The company offers a 36-month payment plan as well that comes with an enrollment fee, which stretches out that very steep ticket price. In reality, these zero-to-60 programs are designed to be for-profit, though there are some different models that take in a percentage of salary among other approaches. With that in mind, though, there’s always an opportunity to build a strong pipeline with certain companies, and if they can identify high-performing students they can offer more of a proof point and potentially use that as an opportunity to offer some variation of scholarship. While this is more of a bootcamp-ish style program, there are already some IT certification programs through tools like Coursera. Google, in one instance, is offering financial aid for a batch of those students, and companies with deep pockets might be able to build out these kinds of pipeline programs on their own. Hess and Kim hope to offer some kind of high-touch approach, instead of just a class on a platform of many, that will give them an edge to be a preferred option.\n",

      "WeWork the co-working startup valued at $20 billion with some 200,000 members across 200 locations globally is continuing with its strategy of expanding into a wide array of adjacent operations to grow its business. Today the company announced that it will be expanding the coding-focused Flatiron School abroad, starting in London this June. Alongside this, it s also launching a scholarship program, offering 1 million in fees to people from underrepresented groups in tech to enrol in Flatiron classes, working with existing local groups like AllBright, Code Bar and Women Who Code to spread the word. This is the Flatiron School s first move outside of the U.S. for its physical classes it had already offered online courses internationally before this and notably it is also WeWork s first significant educational effort since acquiring the New York startup last October for an undisclosed sum. Since acquiring Flatiron, WeWork s chief growth officer Dave Fano who himself joined WeWork when the company acquired his own startup, building infomation modelling firm Case, heralding the start of the company s acquisition spree said that the idea has been to let Flatiron run business as usual, offering a variety of online and in-person coding and related courses. That is now changing as WeWork puts the acquisition to work, so to speak. Expanding the kinds of services that it offers in European markets specifically is an interesting move for WeWork. When it first opened for business here in London, for example, people hiring out desks in other people s offices, or working out of dedicated co-working spaces, was already a standard practice. There was lots of co-working already, so there was no need to educate the market on it, Fano said in an interview. Hence, adding in more services and offerings is a way to help differentiate WeWork from the rest of the productivity pack. Education sits alongside a number of other services that WeWork has been developing, from offering all-in, optimised office spaces (complete with the ever-present glass decanter of fruit-infused water in the kitchen) both for individuals and running then on behalf of other companies, through to event planning (by way of its Meetup acquisition), and likely more down the line. On the other side, this move is also an indication of how Flatiron, which had raised a modest $14 million in funding in its five years of life before getting acquired, is using the acquisition by the well-capitalised WeWork to upsize and compete against the likes of General Assembly and others who have doubled down on international expansion to build out their coding education businesses. Flatiron School s London operation will be based out of Finsbury Pavement, one of WeWork s multiple London locations, and it will kick off with two courses, one a full-time software engineering immersive course that will last 15 weeks; and the other a part-time front-end web developer course that will run 10 weeks. There have been a lot of efforts, both private and public, to help raise tech literacy among the workforces of the world, as industries and economies hope to train people for the next generation of employment as more legacy roles and processes tip into obsolescence, and all signs point to a more digital, connected and technological future. Not all of these have been home runs, though, with many programmes failing to connect the dots between learnings new skills and then applying them in actual jobs. And of course there remains a big digital divide between those who are already socially or economically challenged ever getting access to either the training, or the subsequent work opportunities. The company claims to have a strong success track record for its educational program. In the US, Flatiron School has set the benchmark for programming education with its community-first learning platform, market-aligned open-source curriculum, and outcomes-focused approach to education, claims Adam Enbar, Flatiron School s co-founder and CEO. Since 2012, Flatiron has maintained a 99 percent graduation rate for its Software Engineering Programs in NYC and more than 2,000 students have graduated from Flatiron School to date, across both the on-campus and online programs. With our new Flatiron London location, we ll be able to give more people access to attain the skills they need to create their life s work. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the school said that it also has a 99 percent placement rate for those looking for jobs in NYC in the area of the immersive program, and 97 percent placement overall in software engineering, iOS development and fellowship programs. It s a small start, but offering 1 million in scholarships alongside the launch can offer at least a small boost in trying to fix that problem. And for WeWork, which has now raised $7.3 billion in funding including backing from the seemingly bottomless coffers of Softbank s Vision Fund a $1 million scholarship fund is small change, so hopefully it prove to be successful and it might consider how it can dole out more.

      "What’s the best way to stay up to date on things happening within your industry? Seasoned finance professionals read the Wall Street Journal. Anyone who wants to work in politics reads The Washington Post. In Silicon Valley we have industry-specific news sites like TechCrunch supplemented by Hacker News and others. But what about young business professionals who either don’t plan on staying in one industry their whole life or just want to stay up to date on the broader business/tech/startups/politics world? Morning Brew is a daily newsletter designed for young business professionals. Each morning email has a stock market recap, a few short briefs on the most important business news of the day and a small section with lifestyle content. The result is the perfect mix of Wall Street essentials (like market analysis) and tech news (like a deep dive on Y Combinator). The newsletter, which now has just under 200,000 total subscribers, was founded by Alex Lieberman and Austin Rief in 2015 when they were students at the University of Michigan. “We worked with more than 75 students to help them prepare for interviews and internships and we d always ask the question, How do you keep up with the business world? It was like every student had rehearsed their answers together beforehand, saying something to the effect of I read the WSJ and I read it because it s a prerequisite to say you re well-read in business and it s what my parents do, but it s dense, dry, and too long to read cover-to-cover,” explained the duo. So Morning Brew was born. While initially college-focused, that segment has shrunk to 30% of their total audience with the average reader now 28-years-old working in finance, tech, or consulting. Of course there’s nothing stopping an older reader from signing up, and if anything sites like Axios have shown that even non-millennials may now prefer short bullet-point briefings over traditional long-form reporting. But business-minded millennials are definitely the long-term focus of Morning Brew – and for good reason. The segment is extremely sought after in the advertising world, which has helped the startup monetize early. So far they’ve hosted sponsored native content from brands like Discover Card, Casper and Duke University. The diversity of sponsors shows just how many different industries are trying to reach the demographic. Similar to other newsletter businesses like theSkimm, Morning Brew has mainly relied on word of mouth referrals and an ambassador program of 700+ students to drive new signups. Total subscribers are nearing 200,000 with a daily open rate hovering around 50%, which for reference is at least double most other popular industry newsletters. The long term goal is to grow the newsletter into a brand that can touch all aspects of a young professional’s life, including networking. The site is launching a monthly event series this summer to bring together millennials to network and watch panel discussions, which should provide the off-line community building that has proved successful for other media brands.

      "Juni Learning wants to give every kid access to a quality education in computer programming. The company, part of Y Combinator s latest batch of startups, is taking the same approach that turned VIPKID into the largest Chinese employer in the U.S. and a runaway hit in the edtech market by matching students with vetted and pre-qualified online tutors. While VIPKID focused on teaching English, Juni wants to teach kids how to code. So far, the company has taught thousands of kids around the world how to code in Scratch and Python and offered instruction in AP Computer Science A, competition programming and overall web development. Founded by Vivian Shen and Ruby Lee, Juni Learning was born of the two women s own frustrations in learning how to code. While both eventually made their way to the computer science department at Stanford (where the two friends first met), it was a long road to get there. Lee (class of 2013) and Shen (class of 2014) both had to fight to get their computer educations off the ground. Although Shen grew up in Palo Alto, Calif. arguably ground zero for technology development in the Western world there was only one computer science class on offer at her high school. For Lee, who grew up in Massachusetts outside of Boston, the high school she attended was a computer science wasteland with nothing on offer. As public awareness of women gaining engineering roles, we started discussing how to make education more accessible, says Shen. I was traveling in China and started hearing about these amazing education companies [like VIPKID]. Indeed, Cindy Mi, VIPKID chief executive, was an inspiration for both women. I thought, why couldn t a model like that bring great computer science education to the U.S., Shen says. The company offers different plans starting with an individual tutoring session running about $250 per month. Customers also can sign up for group classes that are capped at $160 per month. When you think about computer science education since it s such an important subject for kids why aren t they getting the best education they can get? Shen asks. The prices were set up after feedback with customers and exists at what Shen said was a sweet spot. VIPKID classes cost around $30 per hour. The company initially had a soft launch in late August and was just accepted into the recent batch of Y Combinator companies. Juni Learning recruits its tutors from current and former computer science students at top-tier colleges primarily in California. The company charges $250 per month for once-a-week classes and pays its teachers an undisclosed amount based on their previous experience teaching computer science to children. The company s product couldn t come at a better time to reach students in both the U.S. and international markets like China. As The Wall Street Journal notes, investing in coding could be the next big thing for Chinese investors in education technology. Coding is about the only course that has the potential to become as important as English for students and for the industry, Zhang Lijun, a venture capitalist who backs Chinese edtech companies, told the WSJ. But nobody knows when that s going to happen. By using a model that s already proven successful in China and resonates with consumers in the U.S., Juni Learning may have gotten ahead of the curve.\n",

      "The price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dropped significantly today off the back of news that South Korea s government might ban trading exchanges. As ever in the world of crypto, the slightest ripple of information can be taken out of context, and that appears to be the case here. Reuters reported comments from Korean Justice Minister Park Sang-ki who said claimed his ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges following enough discussion with a range of government agencies, including the finance ministry. As Reuters itself points out, any draft legislation would require the approval of parliament which could takes months, if not years. Even if that were to happen, the timing seems off with local elections upcoming this year and bitcoin, ethereum and other coins hugely popular among young people in Korea. Looking back just weeks, today s quotes also fly in the face of previous comments from the government s financial regulators, which had said that it plans to prevent minors, foreigners and institutions from owning and trading cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, with Korea the world s largest trader of bitcoin on a country basis, the scare was enough to spread fear and move the market. The price of bitcoin lowered to $13,126, according to Coindesk, that s the lowest since December 30. The price later rebounded as context was added to the minister s comments. Exchanges themselves don t seem to be too moved by the minister s apparent intention. TechCrunch spoke to sources at two Korea-based exchanges both of whom dismissed the comments are politicking from one branch of the government. TechCrunch understands that the government has been in contact with prominent exchanges to gather information, while as reported by Reuters it has visited some exchanges. According to Reuters, some visits were based on looking into the tax situation of exchanges which has led to suggestions that unregistered exchanges may be banned. To sum the situation up, hours after Park Sang-ki s comments, a representative of President Moon Jae-in told Korean media [link in Korean] that the Justice Ministry s position does not reflect that of the entire government. So tl;dr we re no closer to knowing exactly what steps Korea will take to regulate bitcoin exchanges. Korea bans Bitcoin FUD is the new China bans Bitcoin FUD.

      "America delivered more AR/VR revenue than China last year, but Chinese growth in the next five years could see it dominate AR/VR long-term — and not by a small margin. With the potential to take more than $1 of every $5 spent on AR/VR globally by 2022, the natural advantages of the Chinese AR/VR market are a golden opportunity (or threat) for domestic and international players. Combine China with other major countries in the region, and Asia could deliver around half of AR/VR global revenue in five years time. Western companies might need to adopt a we try harder approach to compete at the same level. Since 2015 we ve said that ubiquitous AR could dominate focused VR long-term. While the two markets might merge into unified XR (or some other acronym) one day, they could have very different dynamics for the foreseeable future. AR (mobile AR, smart glasses) could approach 3.5 billion installed base and $85 billion to $90 billion revenue by 2022, while VR (console, PC, mobile, standalone) might deliver 50 to 60 million installed base and $10 billion to $15 billion revenue in the same time frame. (Note: Digi-Capital s base case is that even with 900 million installed base for ARKit/ARCore by the end of this year, AR/VR revenue will only start to scale in 2019.) To understand what s happening across the 55 major AR/VR countries and regions, let s start with VR. America might win the battle for VR VR s smaller installed base, lower mobility and exclusive immersion (i.e. limited plurality) focuses it on entertainment use cases and revenue streams. Entertainment (games, location-based entertainment, video) could take two-thirds of VR sector revenue long-term, with hardware taking just over a quarter due to limited unit sales and price competition. The VR market s country dynamics have much in common with the wider video games market. The U.S. has a significant installed base of Sony s VR capable games consoles (banned in China until recently) and high-end VR-capable PCs. It also has highly profitable core gamer economics, which could give it an advantage if premium standalone VR (neither PC nor mobile tethered) hits its stride in a few years. While China has a much larger mobile installed base, mobile/standalone VR s trajectory took a fundamental hit last year, following the launch of mass-market mobile AR. Combined with lower ARPU for mobile/standalone VR, China is at a relative disadvantage to the West on a per user basis. The U.S. could take around one-fifth of global VR revenue by 2022, making it slightly larger than China. But while the U.S. could win the VR battle, it might be a small victory. Combining China with other countries in the region (particularly Japan and South Korea), Asia could deliver just under half of global VR revenue in five years — over twice North America. Europe (led by the U.K., Germany, France) could also deliver, but the European region combined might only be slightly larger than either the U.S. or China individually. China could win the war with AR The dynamics of AR look very different. An installed base in the billions is coming for mobile AR. If and when Apple launches smartphone-tethered smart glasses (we ve been forecasting 2020 for a while now), that market could grow from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions installed base in five years. Because of this distribution potential, a Cambrian explosion of new use cases and business cases is beginning to emerge. E-commerce sales (goods & services, not IAP), hardware sales, ad spend, app store (non-games and games), enterprise and location-based entertainment hold significant promise for AR long-term. So where VR looks like a subset of the games market, AR s long-term dynamics could be more like mobile. That s where China s natural advantages give it the edge over every other country on the planet (including the U.S.). Chinese ARCore could have an installed base approaching ARKit’s scale globally long-term. Add to that ARKit itself in China, plus domestic Chinese mobile AR from Tencent, Alibaba and others, and a clearer picture of Chinese scale emerges. Then from 2020, smartphone-tethered smart glasses could become premium peripherals to Apple and others phones, again leveraging China s inherent mobile strength. This could see China dominate global mobile AR and smart glasses’ installed bases long-term. Then there s China s market dynamics, business models and economics to consider: What does all this mean for AR? E-commerce could be the largest AR business model, where China (particularly Alibaba) might dominate. Smart glasses hardware sales could come next, with premium Chinese iPhone users core to Apple s potential long-term smart glasses dominance (whether they call them iGlasses or not). Tencent is in prime position for the third-largest business model of AR advertising, which explains its battles with Alibaba (although Facebook Camera Effects could generate more revenue internationally). And that s not to mention Chinese iOS and Android AR app store revenues (both non-games and games), enterprise AR and location-based AR entertainment at scale. Combining China s impending AR installed base, business models and economics, and it could see nearly one-quarter of all AR revenues globally by 2022. This is almost half again what the U.S. might produce in a similar time frame. Merging all the country data for a regional view, and Asia could take more than half, Europe less than one-quarter and North America less than one-fifth of global AR revenues. It s a small world after all Installed bases, use cases and economics are great levelers in tech markets, and so it is for AR/VR. While the U.S. might win VR, China could dominate much larger AR. So whoever wins AR also wins AR/VR globally — right now that looks like China by a country mile. This is not to say that the U.S. and other western countries can t do very well from AR/VR long-term (indeed, we forecast that they should). However Asia, China in particular, is critical to the future of the market. Global players need to find a way to compete, or risk being left behind. While Apple could do well as always, for everyone else it s all to play for.\n",

      "Amazon still won t officially reveal how many consumers worldwide participate in its Amazon Prime membership program, but it did today offer a few new stats related to that program s adoption and growth. The company on Tuesday announced that more new, paid members joined Prime worldwide in 2017 than any other year. It also noted that over 5 billion items worldwide shipped with Prime in 2017, including via one-day and two-day shipping. The company has never before released details around how many items it has shipped via Prime in a year s time, and declined to provide last year s figures for comparison purposes. The closest it got last year was revealing that over a billion items shipped via Prime and Fulfillment by Amazon during the 2016 holidays. To some extent, the increases in membership and shipments represent the expanded reach of Prime in 2017, and its more recent arrival in key markets not only its ability to convert online shoppers to paying members. For example, Prime in 2017 arrived in Mexico, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Singapore, in addition to existing markets including the U.S., U.K., Spain, Japan, Italy, India, Germany, France, China, Canada, Belgium and Austria. Contributing to Prime s growth is the fact that the program is still relatively new to one of the world s biggest markets, India, where it launched back in July 2016. Though India didn t start offering Prime this year, its existence in that country has certainly impacted 2017 s numbers. For instance, India became Amazon s fastest-growing market for Amazon Prime this year, having grown nearly 5 times between the beginning of the year and October, Amazon stated earlier this fall. Today, the company told us that more Prime members joined in India than any other country in its first year. Amazon Prime has grown stateside in 2017, as well. A third-party estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, released a few months ago, said that 63 percent of Amazon customers are now Prime members, and that Prime had grown to 90 million U.S. Prime members. While we don t know the official number of Prime members worldwide, we do know that the number of new paid members in 2017 is at least more than 20 million. This is because Amazon reported tens of millions of new paid Prime members in Q4 2016 a number which Amazon confirmed to mean 20 million. Prime shipments have also likely been impacted by Amazon s ability to get its Alexa-powered devices into customers homes, where they enable easy re-ordering of household staples, like packaged goods, diapers, dog food, and more. After the holidays, Amazon announced it sold tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices worldwide over the holidays. That indicates over 20 million Alexa devices have been sold to date, according to various third-party analysis. Amazon today added that its Alexa-powered Echo Dot along with Fire TV Stick were the best-selling products of the year on Amazon, across manufacturers. They were also the top sellers on Black Friday and the holidays thanks to deep discounts and other big pushes from Amazon. Amazon offered a few other milestones today, alongside its Prime shipment and membership numbers. For example, it noted that Prime members used their digital benefits including Prime Video, Prime Music, and Prime Reading more than ever before. It also said December 30, 2017 was the biggest streaming day of the year around the world for Prime Video; Twitch Prime members worldwide ordered more than five million pre-release games with a Prime discount; and Amazon s fulfillment and shipping network increased by more than 30 percent in square footage worldwide in 2017.\n",

      "There have been two major developments in Chinese equities this month that have the potential to rewire the world financial system. The first, which I have covered extensively on TechCrunch, is the launch of Chinese Depository Receipts, which will provide domestic Chinese investors access to foreign stocks for the first time. Major Chinese tech companies are publicly traded in the U.S. and Hong Kong, which means that potentially trillions of dollars of mainland capital will be unlocked for these companies. The other major story took place last week, when MSCI included Chinese A-shares in its indexes. This is a major, yet underreported, story, and critical for understanding the changing financial tides between China and the world. MSCI is one of the most important index-makers in the world, particularly for emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is the gold standard for benchmarking the asset class, and the index is heavily used by wealth managers and robo-investors to diversify outside of U.S. equities. The company s marketing says 94 percent of pension fund assets follow these indexes, and estimates are that $12 trillion are benchmarked to its indexes. That makes the construction of these indexes extremely political. Which countries should be included in an emerging markets index? What stocks should be added, and at what proportion to others in the index? How strong do investor rights need to be before MSCI is willing to consider a country? An index may be quantitative, but the construction of an index is anything but. For years, China has lobbied MSCI to include its domestic equities into the company s indexes. MSCI has resisted for a whole host of reasons, including lack of transparency around Chinese equity markets and capital controls that prevent dollars/yuan from moving easily across the Chinese border. In engaging with China over the question, MSCI has essentially used its massive influence over passive investors to induce market changes it finds desirable. However, the issue is more complex, since Chinese companies have many different types of shares available to be traded. For instance, Alibaba is a domestic Chinese company, but it is officially owned by a Cayman Islands vehicle, which is then traded on the NYSE, a setup known as an N-share. In addition, through American Depository Receipts, foreign stocks traded in China can be listed in American markets. MSCI has included these two types of shares and more in its indexes for some time. The key issue has been inclusion of what are known as A-shares, which are shares of domestic Chinese companies traded locally in the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges and denominated in Chinese yuan. A-share inclusion would mean an inflow of billions of dollars from Western investors to Chinese equity markets, a huge boon for the Chinese government and domestic investors. That s exactly what happened starting June 1, when MSCI included A-shares in its indexes. Those shares are being phased in, with an estimate of 0.39 percent of the emerging markets index originating from these shares, according to Bloomberg. While it is a low percentage, estimates are that tens of billions of dollars will flow into Chinese equity markets in the coming months in order to match the index. As the weights for the index change, China could represent more than a third of the value of the index according to CNBC. After years of rejecting their inclusion, why the change? Part of it had to do with some relaxation of foreign ownership of domestic Chinese companies. As one example, the Hong Kong Exchange has partnered with its Shanghai and Shenzhen sisters in a stock connect program that allows investors to trade in the other exchanges securities through their home market. That means international investors could buy Chinese stocks in Hong Kong, even if they were listed on the mainland, skirting Chinese capital controls. Yet, MSCI also faced increasingly acute pressure. As it has continued to grow at a rapid clip, the Chinese economy has become one of the guiding lights of global financial markets. The fact that trillions of dollars of market capitalization in an emerging market was not included in the most prominent emerging market index became increasingly untenable. The capital inflows are a huge win for China, but the long-term value is even more important. With foreign investors offered increasing access to Chinese equity markets, there will be less and less relative value for Chinese companies to list in a Western exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ. The ridiculous complexity of Chinese equities with its A-shares, H-shares, Red chips and P-chips could be drastically simplified, with most of the value staying on the mainland instead of seeping out. For America, the inclusion of A-shares is another reminder that its financial hegemony faces increasing competition from the east. The NYSE and London Stock Exchange may be world-leading today, but Shenzhen and Shanghai are hungry to take their place. With Chinese GDP growth at 6.9 percent last year, they increasingly have a shot to dislodge the incumbents.\n",

      "Generals are famously always “studying how to fight the last war,” with the last war’s technology, while dismissing how the world and its tech have changed in the interim. This is true for dissidents, rebels, and culture wars too. Our fears tend to be of 20th century boogeymen, the Nazis and the Soviet Union — but we should be worrying about other things entirely. The world and its dystopias have moved on. The Nazis and the Soviets obviously inspired Orwell’s “1984,” which was stunning, visionary, and enormously influential … while still being slightly myopic compared to Huxley’s earlier, much weirder, and much more subversive “Brave New World.” But Orwell too was already able to prophesy a world in which no one really fought for territory any more. What would be the point? Militaries around the world are constructed primarily for national defense against an invading, conquering force, but invading and conquering territory makes no sense any more. Wealth and power are no longer remotely related to how much real estate or raw materials you control. South Korea’s US-dollar GDP is higher than that of Russia. The US swept Iraq’s military away like gauze paper when they invaded in 2003, but it turns out that, even after you overthrow a brutal dictator, even when it’s one of the most oil-rich nations on the planet, attempting to occupy and control a hostile nation inevitably becomes a horribly expensive catastrophe that costs enormously more than any possible benefits. Nation-states don’t invade and conquer each other any more because of military defenses, or any kind of Pax Americana, or because everyone has gotten nicer and kinder over the last hundred years. They don’t do it because, thanks to technology-driven transformations over that time, it simply doesn’t make any sense; in fact it has become complete madness. Similarly, counterculture individualists and lovers of freedom worry about Nazi fascism or Soviet police states. How twentieth century of us. There are plenty of neo-fascists out there, to my dismay, and we often seem to be doing our best to accidentally construct the tools of a police state out of modern technology — smartphones, drones, facial recognition technology, etc. in the much-abused name of “security.” I’m certainly not suggesting that people or societies today are somehow less likely to construct such horrors because they have grown morally better over time. There are plenty of awful people out there. I am, however, suggesting that awful people today are a lot less likely to aim for fascism or totalitarianism because awful people benefit a lot less from those systems than they used to. The Soviet Union collapsed because it was an economic disaster as well as a moral one. The closest things we have to fascist states today — monarchies like North Korea and Saudi Arabia — are fragile, riven by internal contradictions and internecine warfare, facing the future with desperation and fear. There’s a new playbook for oppression today. Instead of outright totalitarian rule, you construct the appearance of democracy, while controlling it by subtly — in some cases perhaps not even consciously — restricting the options available to individual voters; by controlling a tiered system of “representative” electors behind the scenes; or by simply outright stuffing the ballot box. (There can be much sound and fury about the distinctions between the available candidates, but if you’ve done your job correctly, and made democracy as awful as possible, in general only establishment candidates or easily manipulated narcissists will ever be nominated.) Then you give your people enough freedom to thrive; to create, to disrupt, to innovate. And you siphon as much as you can of that created wealth. You don’t give them enough to actually seriously challenge the establishment, of course; to, say, remake the system so that the siphoned wealth goes to its poor and oppressed people instead of its silent, invisible masters. That is a red line that must not be crossed. But the beauties of this system — call it parasitism — is that it is very rare to encounter a challenger who cannot be co-opted. It vampire-squids enough wealth for its upper-tier members and their families to live lives of extraordinary, gilded luxury, without the unpleasant threat of being assassinated or deposed that comes with outright fascism or totalitarianism. These parasitic systems couldn’t exist without today’s technology. They are mostly networked, not hierarchical. They watch, they adapts, and they distract. They construct shell corporations that shuttle gobs of money around the globe like 747s. And they very rarely needs to resort to violence, because, like the Borg, and like capitalism itself — from which it is distinct, although there are places where it has been so successful that people rarely recognize any difference — parasitism usually has the capacity to absorb all those who confront it. I’m not saying fascism and totalitarianism are things we should be completely unworried about. They’re out there, they’re real, and they’re terrifying. But there are playbooks for how to fight them. Parasitism, though, seems almost unstoppable. Presumably the solution is a technological one; let’s hope it’s discovered soon.\n",

      "African tech in 2017 was about the normalization of market events mostly absent even a decade ago. There were acquisitions, multiple investment rounds, lots of expansion, big strategic partnerships and some surprise failures. Africa is fast becoming home to a dynamic tech sector. Here s a snapshot of the news that shaped that transition over the last year. Investment Andela s $40 million VC raise in October was one of the continent s most notable. The technology training and job placement firm received Series C funding from CRE Venture Capital, DBL Partners, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Salesforce Ventures, among others. Andela said it would use the funds for continued expansion. The coding accelerator marked three years in May by adding a Uganda office to locations in New York, Nigeria and Kenya. New investment also helped moved Africa s startup boom into the used autos space. In May, Nigeria-based Cars45.com raised a $5 million Series A round from the Frontier Cars Group to better connect used-car sellers to digital price quotes, first-time online service histories and offers. 2017 fintech funding went to Nigerian startups Flutterwave ($10 million) and Lidya ($1.25 million). In digital solar, Kenya s PayGo Energy raised $1.4 million. Agtech startup Farmcrowdy received $1 million from investors including Techstars Ventures and Cox Enterprises to bring Nigerian farmers online. In April, South African media and technology giant Naspers made a $70 million (majority stake) investment in Cape Town-based e-commerce company Takealot. South African digital cleaning startup Sweep South concluded a Series A Round backed by, among others, DJ Black Coffee. Several new African tech funding initiatives emerged in 2017. GSMA s Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund made seven of its first nine global investments in African startups. Lagos, London and Nairobi-based TLcom Capital raised $40 million for its new growth-stage Tide Africa Fund. In April, The World Bank launched its XL Africa accelerator to support Sub-Saharan African startups with business mentoring and up to $1.5 million in early-stage capital. In October, U.S.-based private equity firm TPG Growth raised $2 billion for The Rise Fund, founded by TPG CEO Bill McGlashan with Bono s support. In perhaps a sign of things to come, Africa also registered some significant outward tech investment. In September, Naspers added $795 million to its holdings in Berlin-based food delivery company Delivery Hero. Products, Partnerships, Expansion African tech saw a number new products and platforms launch in 2017. In January, MasterCard s 2Kuze an agtech app connecting small-plot farmers to markets, payments and logistics services went live in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Africa s first unicorn, e-commerce venture Jumia, introduced an SME lending program. Safaricom Kenya s largest telecom and M-Pesa mobile money provider went live with its Masoko e-commerce platform in November. Earlier in March, Kenyan communications hardware company BRCK unveiled its SupaBRCK a waterproof, solar-powered Wi-Fi box that operates as a 3G hotspot and off-grid server. Africa also registered on the blockchain bandwagon. Earlier this month, 500 Startups-backed SureRemit launched a crypto token product aimed at disrupting Africa s multi-billion-dollar remittance market. On expansion and partnerships, Facebook was very active on the continent in 2017. FB announced its Africa Bots for Messenger Challenge in February, detailed plans to boost free Wi-Fi on the continent in April and teamed up with MainOne and Tizeti Network to improve Nigeria s net connectivity in November. The company partnered with TechCrunch in October for the debut Startup Battlefield Africa and with CcHub to launch Nigeria s NG_Hub accelerator. Other big Silicon Valley names also registered in Africa in 2017. Microsoft announced the opening of Cloud Form data centers in May and a partnership with Liquid Telecom in August to accelerate cloud adoption in Africa. Off of CEO Sundar Pichai s July Nigeria trip, Google announced plans to train 10 million Africans in digital skills, increase funding to African startups and provide $20 million in grants to digital non-profits and modified versions of products (such as YouTube) in Africa. Google for Entrepreneurs also supported CcHub s European PitchDrive tour in August. The same month, eBay expanded its partnership with MallforAfrica.com to allow African vendors to sell wares directly to American online consumers. On accelerators and capacity building, 500 Startups brought its frontier and emerging markets travel series Geeks on a Plane to Africa for the first time in March. Airbus held its inaugural BizLab pitch event in Nairobi targeting African startups using UAVs, 3D printing, smart sensors and IoT. The MEST incubator got a new CEO, Aaron Fu, and scaled its presence to include programs in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Cote d Ivoire. And in October, Safaricom launched its Safaricom Alpha innovation center in Nairobi, with a goal of leveraging the company s commercial social network (i.e. M-Pesa) to connect people to new product solutions. Contraction and closing up shop Of course, no tech sector expands and grows all the time. In September, Y Combinator-backed French language VOD startup Afrostream shuttered, ending subscription services in 29 countries. In November, Jumia e-commerce competitor Konga slashed 60 percent of its workforce and ended its pay on delivery service, reportedly to cut costs. It s not clear if this is a sign of trouble or a realignment of business strategy, per Konga founder Sim Shagaya s Medium post. Acquisitions, IPOs Exits and public offerings are still scant in Africa s tech landscape. There was a notable acquisition in online real estate startup ToLet.com.ng s purchase of Jumia House Nigeria from e-commerce unicorn Jumia in November. Africa s much anticipated and much delayed IPO of fintech firm Interswitch is expected in 2019, according to Nigerian tech insiders who offered TechCrunch perspective on other African ventures with listing potential. Tech to power African tech and politics collided on several occasions in 2017. In September, anti-government protests in Togo, and the use of social media to mobilize them, led to the president shutting down the internet for several days. In a tech to power success story, Cameroon s #BringBackOurInternet movement developed by local IT activists went global, forcing the country s government to restore connectivity after switching it off in response to demonstrations that started in January. Revenues and space Big revenue news from African tech startups is still elusive, but Paga offered promising info in August. The Nigerian digital payments firm reported its first EBITDA positive quarter, after processing 31 million transactions worth some $1.3 billion since inception. And in July, teams from Nigeria and Ghana launched satellites into space, with a little help from SpaceX and NASA demonstrating the sky was not the limit for Africa s scientists and techies in 2017.

Rappler was started in 2012 by Filipino journalist Maria Ressa and it is a global case study for media in the 21st century with a digital-first platform and focus on independent reporting. The site ranks as the Philippines tenth most popular website, according to Alexa, and it has over 3.5 million Facebook fans. Its articles cover domestic and international news but has expanded into Indonesia. Rappler has also grown to become one of the most critical voices of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte s government. Elected into office in June 2016, Duterte s policies have included a controversial war on drugs that has led to the deaths of over 12,000 Filipinos to date. He is known overseas for calling then-U.S. President Barack Obama a son of a whore and has joked that soldiers are free to rape women among other things. The SEC s issue centers around the ownership of Rappler. The company has taken investment from Omidyar Network, the philanthropic fund from former eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and North America-based media fund North Bridge Media, which counts Quora and Disqus among its portfolio. Philippines law forbids any overseas ownership of media companies, but Rappler claims its investors used a Philippine Depositary Receipt (PDR) to invest. PDRs don t provide voting equity or board membership, making them a vehicle for media investments in the country. National broadcaster ABS-CBN is among others to have used them. The SEC, however, has voided the Omidyar Network s PDR and thus revoked Rappler s Certificate of Incorporation. That essentially amounts to a request to close the business. The SEC has been investigating Rappler s ownership structure since July 2017 when it created a committee to look into the issue. Duterte himself said he would investigate the media firm after he said it was fully owned by Americans. That s led to a belief that there s a political agenda behind this investigation, particularly given past history before the two. The President s comments are just one of a series of flash points between Rappler and the government which have seen the media organization and its staff attacked by supporters of the President and his government, as detailed in a recent Bloomberg story. Rappler confirmed that it will appeal the decision and continue to operate as usual. We intend to not only contest this through all legal processes available to us, but also to fight for our freedom to do journalism and for your right to be heard through an independent platform like Rappler, Rappler wrote in response to news of the SEC s decision. We ve been through a lot together, through good and bad sharing stories, building communities, inspiring hope, uncovering wrongdoing, battling trolls, exposing the fake. We will continue bringing you the news, holding the powerful to account for their actions and decisions, calling attention to government lapses that further disempower the disadvantaged, it added. #ANCRecap: \"I am extremely stubborn. When we fight for what is right, we will stand the line.\" Rappler CEO Maria Ressa says she will not be intimidated with the SEC order closing the online news site. pic.twitter.com/CZvxd22j8T ABS-CBN News Channel (@ANCALERTS) January 15, 2018 The publication was supported by media groups and politicians in the Philippines. SEC s decision revoking Rappler s registration is an authoritarian measure and an attack against press freedom. This is a confirmation that the Duterte government is intolerant of a critical institution, especially from the media sector, Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao said in a statement reported by The Inquirer. The decision, which is tantamount to killing the online news site, sends a chilling effect to media organizations in the country, the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines wrote in a statement. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said it was outraged by the decision. It cited Duterte s comments against Rappler last year which are but one of many threats [he] has made against media critical of him and his governance. Rappler is raising five million PHP (around $100,000) to help with its legal case at this page here. There are three months and 30 days more to run but it has already hit 25 percent of that target.

      "eBay is ramping up its presence in Japan via its latest investment in Asia. The U.S. online retail giant announced today that it has acquired the Japan-based business of pan-Asia e-commerce company Giosis, which is called Qoo10.jp, in an undisclosed deal. eBay originally set up Singapore-based Giosis in 2010 alongside Korea s Gmarket, and as part of today s deal it will give up its equity in the Giosis business outside of Japan. In particular, that refers to Giosis network of e-commerce sites that cover Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and China. Giosis raised $82.1 million from Singapore Press Holdings and others back in 2015. Elsewhere in Asia, eBay invested in India s Amazon rival Flipkart last year as part of a $1.4 billion funding round that saw Flipkart take over the local eBay India business. That deal represented a pivot as such since eBay had originally placed its India bet on Snapdeal, which massively scaled back its operations last year after rejected a potential acquisition by Flipkart. eBay had an unsuccessful effort in China which ended in 2006. Japan has been a relative ray of sunshine compared to other parts of Asia. While it doesn t provide local customer figures, the company said it enables thousands of Japanese businesses to sell products to the 170 million active buyers that it claims worldwide. The Qoo10.jp looks like an effort to grow a business that sells to customers inside Japan. eBay said that Qoo10.jp has around two million. That s a fairly significant number, but it is some way short of Rakuten, which dominates the Japanese e-commerce space with nearly 90 million registered shoppers. Beyond online retail, Rakuten also offers banking and financial services to help raise engagement with customers. Featured Image: Kimberly White/Getty Images for eBay/Getty Images\n",

      "Instagram has taken down content posted by Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny under pressure from a government agency, while YouTube has yet to do so. Navalny and others have criticized Instagram for complying to what they call a politically motivated move to silence him. The issue is around a video accusing a Russian official, deputy prime minister Sergei Prikhodko, of accepting a bribe from prominent businessman Oleg Deripaska in the form of a trip on a yacht populated with upscale escorts. It uses footage posted to Instagram (and later removed) by one of the alleged escorts. Deripaska sued in a local court, which turned around and ordered that the material be removed web-wide, recruiting the Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor to enforce the order. The deadline was yesterday. Among the sites and services complying with the order to remove the content in question is Instagram, which upon doing so was the target of swift rebuke from Navalny and his supporters. .@instagram decided to comply with Russian illegal censorship requests and deleted some content about oligarch Deripaska. Shame on you, @instagram! This content was spotlighted by our corruption investigation https://t.co/Pa4xVQE8MQ Alexey Navalny (@navalny) February 15, 2018 I ve asked both YouTube and Instagram for comment on their actions (or future actions). Facebook confirmed to the BBC that it had complied with the regulator s order, but did not offer any more than a blanket statement regarding how it handles government content take-down requests. In addition to the Instagram and YouTube posts, the Russian court ordered that Navalny s own website be blocked, after he refused to take down the content in question. He and his supporters consider this a blatant attempt to silence him ahead of next month s election, of which Navalny was organizing a boycott.\n",

      "AI research is increasingly being used by militaries around the world for offensive and defensive applications. This past week, groups of AI researchers began to fight back against two separate programs located halfway around the world from each other, generating tough questions about just how much engineers can affect the future uses of these technologies. From Silicon Valley, The New York Times published an internal protest memo written by several thousand Google employees, which vociferously opposed Google s work on a Defense Department-led initiative called Project Maven, which aims to use computer vision algorithms to analyze vast troves of image and video data. As the department s news service quoted Marine Corps Col. Drew Cukor last year about the initiative: You don’t buy AI like you buy ammunition, he added. There’s a deliberate workflow process and what the department has given us with its rapid acquisition authorities is an opportunity for about 36 months to explore what is governmental and [how] best to engage industry [to] advantage the taxpayer and the warfighter, who wants the best algorithms that exist to augment and complement the work he does. Google s employees are demanding that the company step back from exactly that sort of partnership, writing in their memo: Amid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public s trust. By entering into this contract, Google will join the ranks of companies like Palantir, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. The argument that other firms, like Microsoft and Amazon, are also participating doesn t make this any less risky for Google. Google s unique history, its motto Don t Be Evil, and its direct reach into the lives of billions of users set it apart. Meanwhile, in South Korea, there is growing outrage over a program to develop offensive robots jointly created by the country s top engineering university KAIST the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Korean conglomerate Hanhwa, which among other product lines is one of the largest producers of munitions for the country. Dozens of AI academics around the world have initiated a protest of the collaboration, writing that: At a time when the United Nations is discussing how to contain the threat posed to international security by autonomous weapons, it is regrettable that a prestigious institution like KAIST looks to accelerate the arms race to develop such weapons. We therefore publicly declare that we will boycott all collaborations with any part of KAIST until such time as the President of KAIST provides assurances, which we have sought but not received, that the Center will not develop autonomous weapons lacking meaningful human control. Here’s the thing: These so-called killer robots are seriously the least of our concerns. Such offensive technology is patently obvious, and researchers are free to decide whether they want to participate or not participate in such endeavors. The wider challenge for the field is that all artificial intelligence research is equally applicable to offensive technologies as it is to improving the human condition. The entire research program around AI is to create new capabilities for computers to perceive, predict, decide and act without human intervention. For researchers, the best algorithms are idealized and generalizable, meaning that they should apply to any new subject with some tweaks and maybe more training data. Practically, there is no way to prevent these newfound capabilities from entering offensive weapons. Even if the best researchers in the world refused to work on technologies that abetted offensive weapons, others could easily take these proven models off the shelf and apply them relatively straightforwardly to new applications. That s not to say that battlefield applications don t have their own challenges that need to be figured out, but developing core AI capabilities is the critical block in launching these sorts of applications. AI is a particularly vexing problem of dual-use — the ability of a technology to be used for both positive applications and negative ones. A good example is nuclear theory, which can be used to massively improve human healthcare through magnetic resonance imagery and power our societies with nuclear power reactors, or it can be used in a bomb to kill hundreds of thousands. AI is challenging because unlike, say, nuclear weapons, which require unique hardware that signals their development to other powers, AI has no such requirements. For all the talk of Tensor Processing Units, the key innovations in AI are mathematical and software in origin, before hardware performance optimization. We could build an autonomous killing drone today with a consumer-grade drone, a robotic gun trigger and computer vision algorithms downloaded from GitHub. It may not be perfect, but it would work. In this way, it is similar to bioweapons, which can similarly be built with standard lab equipment. Other than outright stopping development of artificial intelligence capabilities entirely, this technology is going to get built, which means it is absolutely possible to build these weapons and launch them against adversaries. In other words, AI researchers are going to kill people, whether they like it or not. Given that context, the right mode for organizing isn t to stop Google from working with the Pentagon, it is to encourage Google, which is among the most effective lobbying forces in Washington, to push for more international negotiations to ban these sorts of offensive weapons in the first place. Former Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt chairs the Defense Innovation Board, and has a perfect perch from which to make these concerns known to the right policymakers. Such negotiations have been effective in limiting bioweapons, chemical warfare and weapons in outer space, even during the height of the Cold War. There is no reason to believe that success is out of reach. That said, one challenge with this vision is competition from China. China has made autonomous warfare a priority, investing billions into the industry in pursuit of new tools to fight American military hegemony. Even if the U.S. and the world wanted to avoid these weapons, we may not have much of a choice. I, for one, would prefer to see the world s largest dictatorship not acquire these weapons without any sort of countermeasure from the democratized world. It s important to note, though, that such fears about war and technology are hardly new. Computing power was at the heart of the precision bombing campaigns in Vietnam throughout the 1960s, and significant campus protests were focused on stopping newly founded computation centers from conducting their work. In many cases, classified research was banned from campus, and ROTC programs were similarly removed, only to be reinstated in recent years. The Pugwash conferences were conceived in the 1950s as a forum for scientists concerned about the global security implications of emerging technologies, namely nuclear energy. These debates will continue, but we need to be aware that all AI developments will likely lead to better offensive weapons capabilities. Better to accept that reality today and work to protect the ethical norms of war than try to avoid it, only to discover that other adversaries have taken the AI lead and international power with it.\n",

      "Big tech firms including Google, Facebook and Twitter have expressed major concern after Vietnam’s government passed a law that promises to introduce tighter restrictions on free speech online. The new regulation passed this week strengthens the government’s position on censoring the internet, drawing Amnesty International to decry that it leaves “no safe place for people to speak freely” in Vietnam. Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) — a group that represents Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Line and others — furthered cautioned that it would harm the development of the country’s digital economy. Among the broad points, the new cyber security law forbids internet users from organizing with, or training, others for anti-state purposes, spreading false information, and undermining the nation state’s achievements or solidarity, according to reports. “This decision has potentially devastating consequences for freedom of expression in Vietnam. In the country s deeply repressive climate, the online space was a relative refuge where people could go to share ideas and opinions with less fear of censure by the authorities,” Amnesty International added in a statement. Internet censorship isn’t new to Vietnam, but the law increases the state’s potential to act. Concern is already high following a string of arrests over the past year which has seen bloggers jailed for discussing environmental issues, politics and more online. Beyond limiting free speech, the cyber law also applies pressure to foreign internet companies who will now be required to operate a local office and store user information on Vietnamese soil. Currently, in the case of Google and Facebook, data on Vietnam-based users is stored overseas in locations such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Google and Facebook both declined to comment, but they are part of the AIC which did make a statement condemning the new law. “The provisions for data localization, controls on content that affect free speech, and local office requirements will undoubtedly hinder the nation s fourth Industrial Revolution ambitions to achieve GDP and job growth,” AIC wrote in a statement. “Unfortunately, these provisions will result in severe limitations on Vietnam s digital economy, dampening the foreign investment climate and hurting opportunities for local businesses and SMEs to flourish inside and beyond Vietnam,” the organization added. The people of Vietnam have also voiced their discontent at the new law. Bloomberg reports that demonstrations took place on Sunday ahead of the voting.\n",

      "Japanese bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange BitFlyer has expanded into Europe after it landed a payment license to operate across the EU. Data from Coinmarketcap.com shows that BitFlyer is the world s 14th largest exchange based on volume, with more than $294 million trading in the last 24 hours at the time of writing. Bitcoin is the dominant choice for BitFlyer users, having account for $287 million of that 24-hour trading. That s around the same amount traded on Coinbase. Unlike some exchanges which offer a gamut of altcoins, BitFlyer has stuck to mainstream crypto by offering its users the chance to buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and popular Japanese option Monacoin. Initially, it plans to stick to Bitcoin in Europe which it will trade with Euros but the company said it intends to offer other virtual currencies such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash later in the year. The exchange s European presence will be anchored in Luxembourg, which is where it was granted its payment license. Japan is one of the world s crypto trading hubs, alongside Korea and of course the U.S., but those in the industry say Europe has potential to grow significantly. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng told TechCrunch in a recent interview that Italy, France, Germany, the UK and Turkey are among his exchange s fastest rising markets. BitFlyer will hope its early landing can give it an important advantage over the competition that will doubtless follow its path to Europe.

      "Look away now if you own bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This won t be breaking news to you if you are invested, but today has seen the entire crypto market fall by double-digit percentages. The price of bitcoin slumped by 15 percent to drop below $12,000 for the first time since December 4. Ethereum, meanwhile, fell by over 20 percent to hover above $1,000 and Ripple is down 33 percent to $1.23 at the time of writing. The price drop is having a huge impact. According to Coinmarketcap.com, a site that is quickly becoming the go-to price checker, just one of the top 100 highest valued cryptocurrencies isn t in the red over the past 24 hours. That s Tether. It s a far cry from when bitcoin hit a record of close to $20,000 exactly a month ago on December 16. Despite the drop, Ethereum, Ripple and the rest of the internet s alt coins have largely fared worse than bitcoin. The top 10 based on coin market caps Numbers 11-20 Finally, a little green ink at number 25 Like all things crypto price related, it isn t clear what is driving the changes. A Bloomberg report yesterday suggested that China is preparing to block domestic internet users accessing international bitcoin exchanges. The country banned Chinese exchanges and ICOs last year. Last week, it emerged that the central government is working to drive out China s bitcoin miners, who are thought to account for the majority on the planet. Many of the bigger names are already expanding overseas in preparation but the news jolted the market. There s also been plenty of speculation around Korea s plans to regulate crypto, although the government has since clarified it doesn t plan an all-out ban on bitcoin and crypto trading. Crypto being crypto, there are some alternative theories, too. It's crazy how one video could have caused this crash. The video that caused this was posted on the main Bitcoin subreddit yesterday and it send a shock wave through the bitcoin community: https://t.co/yqnd0a7rpS UFO Today (@CryptoKong) January 16, 2018 We ve been here before, of course the headline to this story may seem familiar .

      "Alibaba is teaming up with SenseTime, the world’s highest-valued AI startup, to launch a not-for-profit artificial intelligence lab in Hong Kong in a bid to make the city a global hub for artificial intelligence. Alibaba, which is SenseTime’s largest single investor thanks to a recent $600 million round at a valuation of $4.5 billion, is providing financing for the “HKAI Lab” through its Hong Kong entrepreneurship fund. SenseTime said it will contribute too, although the total amount of capital backing the initiative hasn’t been revealed. The partners of the project — which also includes the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) — said the aim is to “advance the frontiers of AI,” which includes helping startups commercialize their technology, develop ideas and promote knowledge sharing in the AI field. That’s all fairly general — Alibaba has a track record of politicking through technology investment schemes in Greater China and Southeast Asia — but one tangible project is a six-month accelerator program planned for September which will welcome AI startups to the HKAI Lab. Alibaba’s Cloud business and HKSTP are among the backers who will help the program offer early-stage funding to successful applicants, while Alibaba and SenseTime will help with mentoring and development during the program. Alibaba sees AI as a fundamental technology that will make a difference to society,” Alibaba executive vice chairman Joe Tsai said in a statement. “We envision the Hong Kong AI Lab to be an open platform where researchers, startups and industry participants can collaborate and build a culture of innovation.” China and the U.S. are the two biggest players in the global AI battle, this project alone won’t divert that but it could stir up potential in Hong Kong. Alibaba maintains tight relationships in Hong Kong, particularly through the fund which is around $130 million in size. While the program is ostensibly aimed at promoting startups in Hong Kong, particularly around AI, it is also sure to galvanize Alibaba’s ties to Hong Kong’s establishment and tech community. Hong Kong is growing as a destination for startups, as a number of the city-state’s key players discussed at a TechCrunch China event last year, but still the issue of talent is a key one and this initiative could benefit Hong Kong in that respect.\n",

      "The proposed acquisition of global payment service MoneyGram by Alibaba s Ant Financial is off after the U.S. government blocked the $1.2 billion deal. Ant Financial, the Alibaba affiliate which controls Alipay China s top mobile wallet and other financial services, announced a deal to buy Nasdaq-listed MoneyGram in April 2017 after it beat off a rival bid from Euronet. Ant initially bid for MoneyGram in January 2017 as a means to develop its cross-border payment network into the U.S., and major corridors including India and the Philippines, but instead it will explore and develop initiatives to collaborate with MoneyGram s business. The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago. Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] will not approve this merger, MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said in a statement. Establishing this new strategic cooperation with MoneyGram will add a partner with global remittance capabilities to our ecosystem and, while Ant Financial won t have a direct ownership relationship with MoneyGram, we look forward to working closely with the MoneyGram team to make our platform even more accessible particularly to unbanked and underserved communities globally and create even better experiences for our customers, added Doug Feagin, President of Ant Financial International. Per terms of the agreement, Ant has paid $30 million to MoneyGram for terminating the acquisition process. MoneyGram s share price dropped by around 10 percent to $12.02 on the news, before recovering to around $12.40 in out-of-hours trading at the time of writing. The collapse of the deal is a huge blow to Ant, which spent much of 2017 developing its mobile payment network beyond China and into Southeast Asia, India, Korea, Japan and other parts of Asia with a series of partnerships and investments. MoneyGram not only added the U.S. to that strategy, but it had the potential to give Ant a physical network of cross-border offices and a much large slice of the global cross-payment industry. But now it is not to be, and it will be interesting to see what approach Ant which is hotly-tipped to go public in a massive IPO will take to fill the void beyond this new strategic business cooperation with MoneyGram. The collapse of the deal marks a second China-led acquisition of a U.S. tech company to have failed during U.S. President Trump s tenure. Back in September, a private equity group was blocked from purchasing Lattice Semiconductor due to potential security risks. Prior to the Trump administration, just three deals had been blocked over the past 27 years. Featured Image: Universal Images Group Editorial (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED)\n",

      "Bitcoin exchange abandons Poland even as the government invites it to a working group In a delightful bit of irony BitBay, a Central European exchange, has shut down operations in Poland even as it received an invitation by the Polish government to participate in a national blockchain working group.

      "Alibaba has expanded its e-commerce empire into South Asia after the Chinese internet giant acquired Daraz in an undisclosed deal. Daraz was founded in 2012 by Rocket Internet and today it operates in Pakistan as well as Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Rocket said in a statement that Alibaba has acquired the entire Daraz business. The deal is the second time Alibaba has bought a Rocket company, the first being Lazada in Southeast Asia two years ago. Rumors of a deal have been rife for the past couple of months, with Bloomberg reporting in March that acquisition talks were ongoing. The deal is part of Alibaba’s second wave of international expansions which see it enter South Asia. The company initially focused on India — where it has backed Paytm — and Southeast Asia with Lazada, but this year it has spread its wings into lower profile but hugely populous countries in South Asia. Pakistan, for example, has a population of over 190 million. The acquisition of Daraz follows a fintech investment from Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, which runs Alipay and other Alibaba financial services. Back in March, Ant paid $184.5 million for a 45 percent stake in Telenor Microfinance Bank, a fintech division from Norwegian operator Telenor, which operates Pakistan’s second largest telco. That one-two punch of e-commerce and fintech (particularly payments) is a common move from Alibaba-Ant, which has made similar deals in India and across Southeast Asia. Beyond Pakistan, it looks like Alibaba is also eying nearby Bangladesh, which has a popular of over 160 million and rising internet adoption. According to reports last month, the Chinese firm is pushing to buy a 20 percent chunk of payment firm bKash, a move that would again push its reach deeper into South Asia.\n",

      "Google is slowing piecing together a strategy for China to ensure that it doesn’t miss out on the growth of technology in the world’s largest country. It’s been months in the making through a series of gradual plays, but further evidence of those plans comes today via a product launch. Files Go — a file manager for Android devices released last year — has made its way to China today. Not a huge launch, for sure, but the mechanisms behind it provide insight into how Google may be thinking about the country, where it has been absent since 2010 after redirecting its Chinese search service to Hong Kong in the face of government pressure. For Files Go, Google is taking a partner-led approach to distribution because the Google Play Store does not operate in China. The company is working with Tencent, Huawei, Xiaomi and Baidu, each of which will stock the app in their independent app stores, which are among the country’s most prominent third-party stores. Let that sink in a little: the creator of Android is using third-party Android app stores to distribute one of its products. On the outside that’s quite the scenario, but in China it makes perfect sense. There’s been regular media speculation in recent about Google’s desire to return to China which, during its absence, has become the largest single market for smartphone users, and the country with the most app downloads and highest app revenue per year. Mostly the rumors have centered around audacious strategies such as the return of the Google Play Store or the restoration of Google’s Chinese search business, both of which would mean complying with demands from the Chinese government. Then there’s the politics. The U.S. and China are currently in an ongoing trade standoff that has spilled into tech, impacting deals, while Chinese premier Xi Jinping has taken a protectionist approach to promoting local business and industries, in particular AI. XI’s more controversial policies, including the banning of VPNs, have put heat on Apple, which stands accused of colluding with authorities and preventing free speech in China. Even when you remove the political issues, a full return is a tough challenge. Google would be starting businesses almost from scratch in a highly competitive market where it has little brand recognition. It’s hardly surprising, then, that it hasn’t made big moves… yet at least. Instead, it appears that the company is exploring more nimble approaches. There have been opportunistic product launches using established platforms, and generally Google seems intent at building relationships and growing a local presence that allows its global business to tap into the talent and technology that China offers. Files Go is the latest example, but already we’ve seen Google relaunch its Translate app in 2017 and more recently it brought its ARCore technology for augmented and virtual reality to China using partners, which include Xiaomi and Huawei. Beyond products, Google is cultivating relationships, too. It inked a wide-ranging patent deal with Tencent, China’s $500 billion tech giant which operates WeChat and more, and has made strategic investments to back AI startup XtalPi (alongside Tencent), live-streaming platform Chushou, and AI and hardware company Mobvoi. There have been events, too, including AlphaGo’s three-game battle with Chinese grandmaster Ke Jie in Wuzhen, developer events in China and the forthcoming first Google Asia Demo Day, which takes places in Shanghai in September. In addition to making friends in the right places, Google is also increasing its own presence on Chinese soil. The company opened an AI lab in Beijing to help access China-based talent, while it also unveiled a more modest presence in Shenzhen, China’s hardware capital, where it has a serviced office for staff. That hardware move ties into Google’s acquisition of a chunk of HTC’s smartphone division for $1.1 billion. The strategy is no doubt in its early days, so now is a good time to keep a keen eye on Google’s moves in this part of the world.\n",

      "As Uber works on trying to find a more profitable path ahead for its transportation-on-demand service, it has sold off one of its units that sat peripherally to that business. Fair, the car leasing startup that announced debt and equity funding of up to $1 billion in October, has acquired the active leasing portfolio of Xchange Leasing, a service Uber first established in 2015 to lease new and nearly-new vehicles to drivers who did not come to the service with their own cars. The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, Fair s co-founder and CEO Scott Painter told TechCrunch in an interview. In December, there were reports that a deal was in the works between the two after Uber decided to wind down the operation. Those reports claimed Xchange s book value for its fleet of 30,000 cars was around $400 million, a figure that Painter did not dispute. As part of the sale, Fair becomes Uber s exclusive partner for leasing services for its drivers in the U.S. who want to lease cars for 30 days or more. Fair also has a direct-to-consumer business and that will continue alongside the deal, but Fair will not be entering into more partnerships with other transportation-on-demand companies that compete with Uber in the U.S.. Uber is big enough for us for now, Painter said. There were reports that Uber was losing around $9,000 per car on the service putting a strain on the company s attempt to stem its losses and build a more financially sustainable business. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber s new CEO, has set a goal of making the company profitable in the next three years. The outsized transportation startup has now raised $22.2 billion and is now valued at $48 billion, but it s been pumping that funding into very aggressive expansion plans that have included passenger and driver acquisition subsidies, fighting regulatory battles, R&D and other costly efforts. It s not an unrealistic goal much smaller transportation companies have been close to or are already in the black. Now the idea is, as the British like to say, horses for courses. Uber will focus on its transportation service and building better relationships with those in its two-sided marketplace of drivers and passengers, while Fair will take on the leasing operation. As we progress on our mission to deliver better experiences for drivers, Uber is excited to partner with companies like Fair that have deep domain expertise and innovative solutions, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a statement. We look forward to working closely with Fair to develop thoughtful, customized options for drivers in the U.S. On the side of Fair, it will be interesting to see how Fair manages the economics of a business that did not prove to be financially fruitful for Uber. Painter argues that in its favor, Fair is only working on leasing services (for now; there will be purchasing options added over time) and has optimised its platform to fit the economics of this model. It s an emerging area of the transportation industry, and one that automakers might also look to get involved in more directly, bypassing the traditional companies involved in renting vehicles, judging by recent moves from Ford and GM. Car ownership is changing, said Painter, a familiar refrain in the automotive world today. The plan for Fair which is backed by strategic investors that include Penske and BMW is to be one of the companies at the center of how cars will be used by consumers in that future. This isn t a completely left-field idea. Even if the price of autonomous and other next-generation cars comes down over time, there are many in the automotive market who question whether they will ever be as affordable to the mass market as cars are today. Still to come will be what the two plan to do outside the U.S., where Fair has yet to expand but wants to. International markets are definitely in our plans, he said, noting that existing regulations for leasing in places like Europe will make entry relatively painless. This could potentially involve expanding its relationship with Uber, or using international markets to work out partnerships with others in the space, given that Uber is not always the dominant player in every country. From what we understand, Fair has also secured and closed more funding, but Painter declined to talk about that in our interview. However, that funding could, in part, be used for an international push. Fair s existing business model is predicated on the idea of an all-in service, where customers monthly fee for leasing a vehicle also includes maintenance and some roadside assistance, with the option also of purchasing insurance through the platform, both to protect the driver and protect our assets. This is the company s first acquisition, after a deal early in its life fell through to buy the assets of failed car selling and buying app Beepi. It s not clear how many staff from Xchange Leasing will be joining Fair as part of this deal. There were 500 employees working in the unit under Uber, and reports in December alleged that the number going to Fair will be around 150. Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n",

      "Workday, the cloud-based platform that offers HR and other back-office apps for businesses, is making an acquisition to expand its portfolio of services: it’s buying Adaptive Insights, a provider of cloud-based business planning and financial modelling tools, for $1.55 billion. The acquisition is notable because Adaptive Insights had filed for an IPO as recently as May 17. Workday says that the $1.55 billion price tag includes “the assumption of approximately $150 million in unvested equity issued to Adaptive Insights employees” related to that IPO. This deal is expected to close in Q3 of this year. IPO filings are known to sometimes trigger M&A. Most recently, PayPal announced it would acquire iZettle just after the latter filed to go public. Skype was acquired by Microsoft in 2011 while it was waiting to IPO after previous owner eBay said it would spin it off. Workday itself went public in 2012 and currently has a market cap of nearly $27 billion. The deal will give Workday another string to its bow, in its attempt to become the go-to place for all for back-office services for its business customers: the company plans to integrate Adaptive Insights’ tools into its existing platform. Adaptive Insights is an industry leader with its Business Planning Cloud platform, and together with Workday, we will help customers accelerate their finance transformation in the cloud,” said Aneel Bhusri, Co-Founder and CEO, Workday, in a statement. I am excited to welcome the Adaptive Insights team to Workday and look forward to coming together to continue delivering industry-leading products that equip finance organizations to make even faster, better business decisions to adapt to change and to drive growth. The two have been working together as partners since 2015. In the case Adaptive Insights, which says it has ‘thousands’ of customers, its growth mirrors that both of cloud services and specifically about how business intelligence has developed into a distinct software category of its own over the years, with not just the CFO but an army of in-house analysts relying on analytics of a business’ data to help make small and big decisions. The market opportunity here is huge as the CFO has become a power player in the C-Suite, CEO Tom Bogan told TechCrunch when it raised $75 million in 2015, when it first passed the billion-dollar mark for its valuation. Bogan previously also held a role as chairman of Citrix. As a former CFO myself, I have seen this first hand and it is accelerating.” Other examples of this force includes Twitter s Anthony Noto catapulting from CFO to COO (and is now a CEO running SoFi). Around 25 percent of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are former CFOs. Adaptive Insights had raised $175 million prior to this. Bogan will stay on and lead the business and report directly to Bhusri. Joining forces with Workday accelerates our vision to drive holistic business planning and digital transformation for our customers, said Bogan, in a separate statement. Most importantly, both Adaptive Insights and Workday have an employee-first and customer-centric approach to developing enterprise software that will only increase the power of the combined companies. More generally, while we have certainly seen a much wider opening of the door for tech IPOs this year, there is also an argument to be made for continuing consolidation it enterprise IT, in particular with regards to cloud services that might have small or potentially negative margins. Adaptive Insights was not immune to that: the company in its public listing filing said that its previous fiscal year brough tin $106.5 million in revenues, up 30 percent from the year before, but it also posted a loss of $42.7 million in the same period. That was narrower than the $59.1 million it posted in 2016. Combined with the bigger trend of all-in-one platforms packing a bigger punch with businesses, it might have meant that Workday’s offer was too compelling to refuse. This looks like Workday’s biggest acquisition yet, but the company has been on a spree of sorts: just last week it announced the acquisition of RallyTeam to beef up its machine learning.\n",

      "Sweden’s Instabridge, the Wi-Fi sharing community and mobile app that has proved particularly popular in Brazil and Mexico, has scored $3 million in further funding — money it’s pegged for Asia expansion, starting with India. The new round is led by Luminar Ventures (headed up by Magnus Bergman and Jacob Key), with participation from previous backers Balderton Capital, Draper Associates, Moor, and Creandum. The company had previously raised around $5 million. Originally founded in late 2012 as a way to enable you to share your home Wi-Fi with friends on Facebook, the Stockholm-based company has since pivoted to become a broader Wi-Fi sharing community, and has found traction in developing markets where cellular data remains prohibitively expensive. The Instabridge app lets you share the details of any Wi-Fi hotspot with other Instabridge users, and provides access to Wi-Fi hotspots shared by everyone else in the community. This has enabled it to build a crowdsourced database of Wi-Fi hotspots, in addition to a list of known public venues that have free Wi-Fi, such as McDonald s or Starbucks. Instabridge says it plans to build on the traction it has seen in South America by targeting India’s population of over 1 billion people, of which it says only 400 million currently have internet access. This, Instabridge co-founder Niklas Agevik tells me, will include building out a team in India, and plays into the company’s new-found mission of expanding internet access in developing countries where internet services remain relatively expensive and yet access to the internet is a proven means of “reducing income inequality”. Meanwhile, I’m told that Instabridge is now seeing 2.3 million Monthly Active Users, and is growing at a rate of 50,000 new users per day. The Instabridge database now houses the details of 2 million Wi-Fi spots.\n",

      "Google is back investing in ride-hailing companies. The U.S. search firm and China s Meituan-Dianping are among the tech giants set to invest in Go-Jek, the Indonesia-based rival to Grab and Uber, a source with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. We understand a deal could be completed as soon as next week, though whether Go-Jek announces it is unclear since it has history of not disclosing new investments. Reuters reports that round is worth $1.2 billion, and we re hearing that is accurate but with a caveat. These new investors are part of a follow-on to an investment made last year, according to our source. Funding rounds are often complicated and not as clean as they may appear once announced. In Go-Jek s case, it secured investment from Chinese internet giant Tencent in March last year as an initial tranche of a planned $1.2 billion raise. Existing investors including KKR, Warburg Pincus, Sequoia Capital, Northstar Group, DST Global and NSI Ventures agreed to follow on and Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com joined later in the year, too, but an allocation was left open. Now that is full and the round is complete with commitments from Google, Temasek and Meituan-Dianping. We don t have confirmed numbers for those stakes but, as latecomers to the party, they are likely to be fairly small and strategic in nature. We understand the investment gives Go-Jek a valuation that is a touch above the $3 billion that Tencent agreed to invest at last year. Google declined to comment. Representatives from Go-Jek, Temasek and Meituan-Dianping did not respond to requests for comment. Go-Jek previously raised $550 million in 2016 so this is a big jump, but the competition has also increased its rounds by significant multiples. Singapore-based Grab has raised more than $4 billion to date, including a $2.5 billion round led by SoftBank and China s Didi Chuxing at a $6 billion valuation. Uber remains the world s highest funded private tech startup with over $20 billion from investors, including a recent cut-price valuation deal with SoftBank. Interestingly, our source confirmed that Google itself is investing directly rather than its Google Ventures unit. Just one month ago, Google made its first direct investment in India when it backed concierge app Dunzo. That, combined with the Go-Jek investment, indicates an increased interest in India and Indonesia, two of the world s most promising emerging markets for tech and consumer internet services, beyond the product work it is doing in both regions. It also adds another wrinkle to the complicated relationship of ride-hailing companies worldwide. Google Ventures invested in Uber in 2013 and, after a legal suit caused the relationship to get frosty, it backed Lyft last year. Meituan-Dianping, meanwhile, may not be well known in the west but it is another significant addition. The company was formed through a merger between China s top two local commerce platforms and is valued at $30 billion. Beyond providing a platform that lets physical retail stores tap the internet for business, it is aggressively moving into ride-sharing in China where it hopes to rival Didi thanks to a $4 billion investment that closed last year. A foray into Southeast Asia through Go-Jek makes sense in that context, but Meituan-Dianping may also look to work with Go-Jek to expand its core service known as offline-to-online in Indonesia, which is the world s fourth most populous country with over 250 million people. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said Southeast Asia is unprofitable, but the region which is home to 600 million consumers is tipped to see huge growth. Ride-hailing in the region is predicted to become a $20.1 billion per year industry by 2025 up from $5.1 billion in 2017, according to a report co-authored by Google. With Southeast Asia s largest economy, Indonesia is likely to account for the majority of that a prior 2015 Google-affiliated report pegging its share of revenue at more than 40 percent. (You can t accuse Google of not doing its homework.) Go-Jek itself was founded in 2011 and it began to make a name for itself a few years ago through its core motorbike tax on-demand service. Bike taxis already exist in many of Southeast Asia s largest cities where they are popular options for cutting through congested streets and getting from A to B faster than four wheels. Go-Jek has since expanded to offer regular taxis, services and shopping on-demand and a mobile payment service, which is being pushed as an offline option too. Its core office is in Jakarta but it has an engineering presence in India. The company is widely thought to be ahead of Grab and Uber in Indonesia, which remains its only market. Uber and Grab both offer similar motorbike taxi options in parts of Southeast Asia, while Grab has also ventured into the mobile payment space. Yesterday, it completed its second acquisition to boost its GrabPay service. Featured Image: BAY ISMOYO/Getty Images\n",

      "Here is an interesting twist: GitLab, which in many ways competes with GitHub as a shared code repository service for teams, is bringing its continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) features to GitHub. The new service is launching today as part of GitLab’s hosted service. It will remain free to developers until March 22, 2019. After that, it’s moving to GitLab.com’s paid Silver tier. GitHub itself offers some basic project and task management services on top of its core tools, but for the most part, it leaves the rest of the DevOps lifecycle to partners. GitLab offers a more complete CI/CD solution with integrated code repositories, but while GitLab has grown in popularity, GitHub is surely better known among developers and businesses. With this move, GitLab hopes to gain new users — and especially enterprise users — who are currently storing their code on GitHub but are looking for a CI/CD solution. The new GitHub integration allows developers to set up their projects in GitLab and connect them to a GitHub repository. So whenever developers push code to their GitHub repository, GitLab will kick off that project’s CI/CD pipeline with automated builds, tests and deployments. Continuous integration and deployment form the backbone of modern DevOps, said Sid Sijbrandij, CEO and co-founder of GitLab. With this new offering, businesses and open source projects that use GitHub as a code repository will have access to GitLab s industry leading CI/CD capabilities. It’s worth noting that GitLab offers a very similar integration with Atlassian’s BitBucket, too.\n",

      "500 Startups may soon be coming up on the one-year mark for the end of a tumultuous saga involving its founder, but its accelerator classes still continue to plug along and its next batch is now getting ready to roll. The firm’s 23rd batch of startups this year consists of the usual mix of business to business and consumer companies (even coffee) that end up in each class. This class is definitely a smaller one, but it still seems to spread a pretty wide number of different verticals. There’s also, of course, a blockchain track for this class, though a small percentage of the startups in it are taking part of that and there was still a certain rigor they had to have to run through it. “For every major tech movement, for every tech phase, there’s the infrastructure phase and the deployment phase,” 500 Startups partner Marvin Laio said. “Our view, with the blockchain, we’re in the infrastructure phase. A lot of these projects outside that we see and read about, they’re kind of bad. They’re really applications. There’s no point having a mobile app if you don’t have the app store. You need to build out the app store. For better or worse, we’re in the infrastructure phase right now.” The firm is still clearly making some pretty big changes, including an unconventional deal with the Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG) that gives it a stake in the firm’s parent company. The terms of that deal weren’t disclosed, it was another move among many by CEO Christine Tsai to begin to rework the mechanics of how the firm works especially as it hopes to succeed as both a venture fund as as a program for entrepreneurs looking to get their companies off the ground. Dave McClure, the firm’s co-founder, resigned last year following allegations of sexual misconduct, and since then it’s been trying to get back to business as usual. 500 Startups takes a similar approach to other accelerators, where they will invest around $150,000 for a small chunk of equity and then take on a small amount of that back (a little more than $37,000) for program fees. The firm has primarily been known for its savvy when it comes to growth and marketing, so the support entrepreneurs get usually has that as a core part of the experience.

      "Max Rhodes was walking around that weird little parklet in Hayes Valley in San Francisco after taking a break from a five-year stint at Square to figure out what he wanted to do next and he kept seeing Square registers everywhere. It was spotting them over and over again in smaller retail shops dotted throughout the city that made him think about the connections between the average product maker that kind of small group making a bespoke funny candle and those retailers. That s what prompted him to start Indigo Fair, a platform that connects those two entities in order to streamline the process of getting those products into smaller retail stores that are looking for just those kinds of weird candles throughout major urban areas. The company said it has raised $12 million in new financing from Forerunner Ventures and Khosla Ventures, with Forerunner s Kirsten Green joining the board of directors. I started to think about the fact that you have all these stores adopting cloud-based PoS systems and inventory systems and, generally all their data is becoming available through their media profiles and inventory systems, Rhodes said. If there were some way that you could get all that data and know what is selling where, you could actually predict how well a given product is gonna sell in a store. That was the starting point. As so-called big box shopping increasingly shifts online, the theory is that there will be more and more niche retail outlets looking for interesting products that try to capitalize on the core original shopping experience, which is more social and curated. Indigo Fair receives hundreds of applications from makers every week though, as more and more tools become available to create more complex products, that s probably only going to increase and the team accepts about 5 percent of those applications. Part of the reason is to keep a good handle on the company s growth and still make sure it has that curated feel for retailers, who know they are getting their hands on a good product. They send in some information and then start getting orders, print out a shipping label and then start sending the product out to those retailers. On the retailer end, the shops sign up and immediately have access to those products available through those wholesale makers. Indigo Fair aims to cut out the process of spending tens of thousands of dollars on trips to trade shows with makers to find the right products and then get them in their stores with the hope that they ll sell. If you go into one of the stores on Valencia Street in San Francisco, you ll probably find quite a bit of weird stuff that those stores hope to sell. Indigo Fair looks to try to streamline that process and make it easier to get those products in-house without all the travel and hassle. Of course, even using public data as a starting point, gathering the data to make the model defensible is the harder part. After all, there are a lot of online platforms looking to empower wholesale makers to get their goods into the hands of consumers, though the company today said it s actually partnering with Shopify and Square. But as the company gets more and more information about what s selling, what isn t and who s returning what, it gets a better sense of consumer demand for a product and where to put it to keep the cost for both of those entities down. In so many ways it s the age-old challenge of marketplaces, Green said. I think it requires you to be very scrappy, it requires you to find good customers that believe in the proposition and the potential for the product that they re willing to start working with you in that regard. There is a lot of info you can readily access online today. Just having the patience and the commitment to try to put a bunch of that together on your own platform so you can start building the data set is just some of the heavy lifting involved. Rhodes hope, amid increasing competition and different models and approaches like Simon which wants to help startups get pop-up shops in malls is that with his experience dealing with the problems first-hand, and with enough data, Indigo Fair will become a go-to service for both retailers and product makers. Rhodes, a former consultant at Bain who helped build Square Cash, with his co-founders Marcelo Cortes and Daniele Perito, look to lean on everyone s experience getting an expensive umbrella in stores and selling it across North America to enable every product maker to get the same thing done.\n",

      "You don’t hear of many $2 loans in the United States, where $2 won’t buy you more than a chocolate bar. But in cities like Lagos, Nigeria, and Nairobi, Kenya, $2 has the buying power of roughly $40, making such “micro” loans useful when you’re running a small business. And borrowing $2 from a startup called Branch is a way onto a platform that promises much bigger loans, based on your credit worthiness. What is Branch and why is it bothering with such small amounts of money? For answers to those questions, we talked this week with its founder and CEO Matt Flannery, who previously cofounded and co-led Kiva, a now 14-year-old micro-lending platform that enables families to make small loans to entrepreneurs in developing countries. Flannery realized while running Kiva that a nonprofit — which Kiva is — can only get so far when it comes to fundraising. Meanwhile, fascinated by the spread of smart phones and digital payment systems in Africa, Flannery knew that if he could raise serious capital, he could make even more loans to small business owners without needing to meet and interview them first. In service to that idea, what Branch built is an app that analyzes all kinds of information on a user’s phone that determines how to score their credit. For example, in Nigeria, every time you use an ATM, the bank sends you an SMS message with your bank balance. That’s useful information to Branch. In Kenya, every time you pay your energy bill, the receipt comes via SMS. Knowing if you pay it and how big a bill you’re paying is valuable information, too. Users apparently don’t see the app as invading their privacy — or it’s worth the trade-off to them if they do. Since its 2015 founding, Branch has been downloaded onto more than one million mobile phones in Sub-Saharan Africa, says Flannery. Based on that momentum, Branch has attracted the kind of financial muscle Flannery was seeking when he left Kiva to start the company. In fact, Branch is announcing today that it has lined up $70 million in Series B funding to expand its financial offerings to additional countries, including India. Trinity Ventures led the $20 million equity portion of the round, along with participation from International Finance Corporation, Andreessen Horowitz and CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund. Branch also secured a $50 million debt facility from Victory Park Capital, an investment firm with a focus on alternative credit whose other portfolio companies include LendingClub and LendUp. Altogether, Branch has now raised $80 million. It suggests that lending incremental amounts isn’t just helpful to small business owners in developing countries; there’s a lucrative opportunity in it. “The banking infrastructure in the U.S. is so robust and complete,” says Schwark Satyavolu, the general partner at Trinity Ventures who led the round for his firm. Meanwhile, Branch, he says, “seems like an application of Silicon Valley tech to create financial services. But it’s substantially more interesting, because Branch is doing it in emerging markets where you don’t have a robust stack or credit bureaus or information that’s nearly as rich or as deep as in the Western world.” It’s worth noting that Branch is not a bank, despite that it calls itself a “branchless bank.” Its straightforward terms of use are just one giveaway. Branch charges 15 percent interest on a loan as low as $2 at the end of one month. It also charges a 15 percent APR on its largest loans, which are $1,000 and can be paid over a 12-month period. Branch basically loses money on the $2 loan in order to drum up repeat business — and the strategy is working, according to Flannery. New customers borrow from Branch 20 times on average in the first year after they’ve downloaded the app. If that sounds like a risky proposition for new borrowers, the good news, in our view, is that Branch never charges its users overdraft fees. “I’ve worked in microfinance long enough to know that late fees create a cycle of debt,” Flannery says. What investors like even more is that Branch — which has 100 employees in San Francisco, Lagos, and Nairobi — was profitable before taking on this new funding. It’s also growing 20 percent month over month, and it plans to roll out savings accounts next. “We see savings as a critical next step,” says Flannery. “People typically don’t have them, or the yield is super low to non-existent.” It will be a “big regulatory issue for us,” he says, explaining such accounts could be a year out, based on Branch’s dealings with the banks it needs as partners. It’s worth it, though, he adds. There’s a “big opportunity in these places.”\n",

      "Aurora, the self-driving startup founded by Google self-driving car project alum Chris Urmson, along with Tesla Autopilot developer Sterling Anderson, CMU robotics expert and Uber vet Drew Bagnell, and a team of industry experts, will be making the autonomous smarts for Byton s forthcoming electric vehicle. Byton, a startup that had a splashy debut at CES earlier this year. Byton s Concept electric SUV is a car with a lot of interesting tech features, aside from its all-electric drive train. The vehicle has a massive, dashboard-covering display that incorporates information readouts, entertainment options and vehicle controls. It s a screen that seems somewhat ill-suited for the task of paying attention to the road while driving, and the Byton car also has front seats that swivel towards the inside of the vehicle so that those in the front can better interact with those in the back. Both of those features are more geared toward a future in which autonomous driving is a ready and viable option for Byton owners. The car is aiming for a 2019 starting ship date, by which time it s possible self-driving features won t seem such a distant dream. And now we know that Byton has a technology partners on the autonomous driving side of things with the technical know-how to make it an even more realistic expectation. Aurora, despite officially breaking cover only just last year, is already working with a range of automakers on their autonomous driving technology, including Volkswagen and Hyundai. Aurora CEO Chris Urmson explained that its goals mean it s happy to work with companies at all stages of development and maturity to help make self-driving a practical reality. Our mission is to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safety, quickly and broadly, he said in n interview. So for us to have that broad part, it means we have to work with a number of great partners, and we re very fortunate with the folks we have [as partners] to date this is how we help the business, and we look forward to being able to engage with others in the future. For Byton and Aurora, this partnership will kick off with pilot test driving in California sometime soon, and Byton hopes to eventually tap Aurora with its goal of fielding premium electric consumer vehicles with SAE Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous capabilities. Aurora as a company is excited about its progress during its first year in operation, and is ramping up staffing and attracting key talent in a very competitive industry thanks to its pedigree and founding team, Urmson tells me. It started with a handful of us, a couple in my living room here in California, and a couple in Pittsburgh. We ve been growing the team, that s been one of the core focuses of this last year, he said. In my previous gig I had the privilege of helping build that program from day one, to a massive organization certainly leading the space, and now with Sterling and Drew, we have the opportunity to build version two of that, and learn from our experience, and build an organization and build a technology that can have a huge impact on the world, and do that quickly and safely.\n",

      "Alibaba Group announced today that it has agreed to sell several of the healthcare categories on Tmall, its B2C shopping platform, to digital healthcare subsidiary Alibaba Health Information Technology. In exchange, Alibaba Group will receive $10.6 billion HKD (about $1.35 billion) in newly issued shares of Alibaba Health and increase its equity stake in the company, which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, from 48.1% to 56.2%. If you have followed Alibaba Group for a while and this news is giving you a feeling of d j vu, there s a reason why. In April 2015, Alibaba Group made a similar announcement, saying that it had agreed to integrate Tmall s pharmacy business into Alibaba Health in exchange for a majority stake. The next year, however, Alibaba Health disclosed to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that it had let the proposed deal lapse because of regulatory uncertainties as the Chinese government reviewed legislation related to online drug sales. In that disclosure, it also said that Alibaba Group “continues to support [Alibaba Health] to execute an organic growth and investment strategy as the healthcare flagship company for Alibaba Group,” with the two companies exploring service agreements between Tmall and Alibaba Health. While the deal announced today is still subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, it furthers Alibaba Group s goal of consolidating more of Tmall s pharmacy and healthcare business operations into Alibaba Health. These include Tmall categories like medical devices and healthcare products and medical services, which in total cover 3,300 vendors and generated 20.6 billion RMB (about $3.2 billion) in gross merchandise volume in the fiscal year that ended in March. Vendors moving over to Alibaba Health will now have access to its ecosystem, including data analytics, hospitals, doctors, healthcare consultants and equipment suppliers, creating more growth and synergy opportunities, an Alibaba spokesperson told TechCrunch. In a press statement, Daniel Zhang said “Healthcare is a strategically important area for Alibaba Group with strong growth potential. This transaction is a logical evolution for the continued development of Alibaba Health into our healthcare flagship platform.”\n",

      "Mammoth Media has raised a $13 million Series A funding to create what it calls entertainment experiences for the mobile-first generation. Mammoth isn t not the first startup to pitch itself as reinventing entertainment for smartphones, but for the most part, that message has come from gaming companies. Co-founder and CEO Benoit Vatere said he wanted to take the mobile-centric approach beyond gaming and social media. Rather than mixing social and media, Vatere said the focus at Mammoth is content and content alone. That doesn t mean excluding social entirely. For example, Mammoth made the Wishbone app, where users can vote on things Who s cuter? , but Vatere said Wishbone is more like America s Funniest Home Videos than it is a social networking app the focus is on creating shareable content, not on talking to your friends. Mammoth also created Yarn, one of the apps delivering fiction in a text message format. The company says that the average Yarn subscriber (pricing starts at $2.99 per week) spends 50 minutes reading in the first week. According to App Annie, Yarn been the number one books app in a number of countries, including the United States. The app recently launched Hack d, a horror series featuring Musical.ly star Kristen Hancher. Vatere said we can expect to see more series starring social media influencers after seeing reaction videos to Yarn content, his team thought, Why not, instead of having them react to the story, have them in the story itself? Vatere also plans to continue launching new apps. The idea is to continue experimenting with new formats, which means some of the apps probably won t take off, but he s hoping to launch one very successful experience each year. This also requires a sustainable and repeatable model for building audiences. Virality is key to helping growth, but virality cannot sustain a business, Vatere said. You have to be able to do user acquisition properly You need to udnerstand how much you can afford per user. We have the engine that tells us that. The funding was led by Greylock Partners, with participation from Science Inc., the venture studio where Mammoth was incubated. Greylock s Josh Elman wrote that he ll be joining the Mammoth board, and he noted that this is his first investment in Los Angeles. I m #longLA and I believe there will be many more great companies that bridge technology and entertainment and LA will be a great place for those companies to grow and prosper, Elman said.\n",

      "Google is temporarily halting advertisements worldwide for addiction and rehabilitation centers, following a report last week showing it was acting as a platform for shady referral services earning huge undisclosed commissions. Essentially these ads, which commanded huge prices on Google s networks, would show for people seeking addiction treatment; the help lines and services listed would then refer the person to an addiction center. These centers were, unknown to their new patients, paying enormous finders fees to the referral services, on the order of tens of thousands of dollars. The company announced the decision to ban this practice globally in a statement issued to TechCrunch: Substance abuse is a growing crisis and even as we ve helped healthcare providers connect with people who need help, unfortunately there s also been a rise in deceptive practices from bad actors taking advantage of those in need. This is a complex issue with varying degrees of regulation in different countries, which is why we ve decided to suspend ads in the entire addiction treatment center category globally while we consult with experts to find a better way to connect people with the treatment they need. Ads of this type, for referral lines and services that point people dealing with addiction to clinics and other resources, were stopped in the US in September, after a Verge report highlighting the practice. The company stopped showing ads in the UK following the Sunday Times investigation. When the practices would have been detected and stopped without a vigilant press is anyone s guess. Apparently following last week s report, Google felt the risk of this type of thing happening elsewhere was enough to warrant suspending the whole business. It s also possible the company internally confirmed that it was enabling it elsewhere; a look at the ad numbers would be all it would take, considering Google was reportedly making millions from this highly competitive marketplace. The ads won t disappear overnight, but rather will be phased out, presumably to avoid any kind of unpleasantness relating to contracts and such. They ll come back once Google s people find some way to serve them minus the risk of systematic abuse. As seems to be the standard with ad-focused companies these days, this kind of action only seems to take place after someone outside the company drags a questionable practice into the public eye. One would think such large, wealthy companies would be able to detect it first, but it is also worthwhile to remember Upton Sinclair s observation that it is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it. I don t mean to say that Google and Facebook are actively aware of wrongdoing or shady tactics on their platforms and deliberately doing nothing about it (although it s certainly possible), and I know there are people in them that actually care about the ethics of these things. But the current system of others pointing out a problem and the companies apologizing all the way to the bank seems to be working pretty well for them. Why rock the boat? At any rate in this case one can hardly argue with the results: people seeking help will still get it but companies preying on them will be sidelined. Here s hoping a few more predatory advertising practices are uncovered and corrected.\n",

      "Spotahome, a Madrid-based startup that lets you view and book mid to long-term accommodation online, has made its first acquisition after raising 13.6 million in Series A funding late last year. The proptech company has acquired international student community Erasmusu, a move that will see Spotahome add up to 70,000+ more properties to its rental inventory and gain access to what co-founder and CEO Alejandro Artacho tells me is the largest network of Erasmus students in Europe . Terms of the deal remain undisclosed, though I understand the purchase price is several million Euros (update: one source pegs it at 2 million) and was a mixture of cash and stock. Notably, Erasmusu, which was started by its founders as a side project eight years ago before becoming a leader in the space, hadn t raised VC backing and has been largely bootstrapped. In that sense, it remained ripe for the picking. Erasmusu currently claims 2 million visits per month (of which I m told 80 percent is organic), is growing 2.5x year over year, and has half a million active students who are looking for homes and, crucially, writing content for the site. It s this community building aspect, in addition to Erasmusu s lean startup achievements, that Artacho says Spotahome can learn from. In many aspects, the two startups were competitors, too. Spotahome aims to solve the problem of how to find mid to long-term accommodation online, including negating in-person viewing for the tenant. Key to this is the startup s insistence that all accommodation is vetted in-person by members of the Spotahome team. These Home checkers visit every property to create accompanying audio-visual material and to verify the listing. And whilst Erasmusu started out focused on building an online community for Erasmus students, covering various aspects of international student life, it quickly found that finding accommodation was one of its most active topics. This led the Spanish company to add classified ads for rentals, before evolving into a transactional model in 2015 pitting it against other rental marketplaces, including the much younger Spotahome. Now that the acquisition has closed, Spotahome has already begun to power the rentals aspect of Erasmusu, although the two sites and teams will remain independent. This is seeing Spotahome undergo the quite labour intensive process of creating audio-visual material (or what might be called virtual tours) for all of the accommodation listed on Erasmusu. In other words, bringing the Spotahome experience of finding a place to live to Erasmus students. In return, Spotahome supercharges not only its inventory of properties, but also the countries and cities it is now active in. The newly-formed Spotahome Group which points to more acquisitions in the not-so-distant future now offers more than 115,000 flats, houses, rooms and student residences in 450 cities across 65 countries. Artacho says the startup also has a much broader user base now with 0.5m active users and 3m visits per month, whilst the new combined entity employs over 235 staff.\n",

      "Lyft is partnering with Magna, one of the largest tier-one automotive industry suppliers in the world, on autonomous vehicle technology. Lyft CEO and co-founder Logan Green explained that this will help them get their self-driving tech into various automaker vehicles around the world. Lyft will be working directly with Magna on “co-developing” an autonomous driving system, with collaborative teams from both companies working on the project. Magna is also investing $200 million in Lyft in exchange for an equity stake. The goal is to build not only autonomy into production vehicles, but also to put direct access to Lyft’s hailing platform into future autonomous vehicles using the platform. Lyft will lead the development effort of the autonomous driving platform from the Level 5 autonomous driving engineering center in Palo Alto, and Magna will take point on manufacturing, working on site at Lyft’s facility in collaboration with the ride-hailing company’s own engineers. Green explained that the company’s goal has been to “improve how transportation works” from the very beginning, citing a childhood growing up in traffic, trying to figure out how to avoid traffic, as a motivating factor. He also noted that it’s “wildly expensive” for individuals to own and operate their vehicles. All ridesharing makes up just 0.5 percent of all miles traveled, and Lyft’s goal is to move that to more than 80 percent, Green said. He cited examples like Netflix as showing what he wants to achieve in the transportation industry, in terms of moving from ownership to subscriptions. In terms of helping Lyft to scale its vision, teaming up with Magna could be a big help: The supplier knows the ins and outs of putting certified, mass-produced key components and systems into vehicles that make their way to public roads and consumers from the world’s leading automakers. Lyft and Magna are not sharing any info with regards to a timeline for when we might see the results of this partnership put into practice, in testing or in production, but Magna noted in a press release detailing the news that it should be “market-ready over the next few years” if all goes to plan. Initially, according to Green, the collaboration will aim to deploy SAE Level 4 autonomous driving tech first, but ultimately the aim is to produce the best Level 5 system available. The product of the collaboration will be “joint intellectual property,” per Lyft Chief Strategy Officer Raj Kapoor, who also explained that both companies will leverage data resulting from testing and use of the AV platform. As for Lyft’s own efforts with developing autonomous vehicle systems thus far, the company said during a press event about the news that it’s already testing vehicles at the GoMentum autonomous vehicles proving ground in California, just five months after making its autonomous engineering efforts official.\n",

The company will immediately relocate 30 team members to a shared space in Bamboo Detroit in the Madison Building and by the end of the year, plans on moving into a 9,000 square foot space to accommodate additional employees. This is a big win for Detroit. Duo Security is one of the hottest security startups in the space and arguably one of the largest in the state of Michigan. The company raised a $70 million series D in late October 2017, placing its valuation north of a billion. Duo employees 350 people in Ann Arbor, Michigan and an additional 250 in other offices around the world. Through it all Duo has remanded loyal to Ann Arbor but the talent and excitement in Detroit is impossible to ignore. “Metro Detroit has more engineers per capita than any region in the US next to Silicon Valley,” CEO and co-founder Dug Song tells TechCrunch. “And while our college town of Ann Arbor is a cornerstone of innovation in the region, the urban area of Detroit is nearly 4 million people strong. Jon Oberheide and I have been eager for Duo to help play a role in the city s growing momentum and support ongoing efforts to bolster the region s technology profile.” Dug tells me that the company picked Bamboo to house the first Duo employees as a move back to the company’s roots. Duo was founded in a coworking space and the company is ready to help build a the platform for the city. Duo is moving into the Madison Building, which is one of the pillars of the startups community in Detroit. It was one of the first buildings real estate mogul Dan Gilbert purchased when moving Quicken Loans to downtown Detroit.

      "European Union lawmakers want online platforms to come up with their own systems to identify bot accounts. This is as part of a voluntary Code of Practice the European Commission now wants platforms to develop and apply — by this summer — as part of a wider package of proposals it’s put out which are generally aimed at tackling the problematic spread and impact of disinformation online. The proposals follow an EC-commissioned report last month, by its High-Level Expert Group, which recommended more transparency from online platforms to help combat the spread of false information online — and also called for urgent investment in media and information literacy education, and strategies to empower journalists and foster a diverse and sustainable news media ecosystem. Bots, fake accounts, political ads, filter bubbles In an announcement on Friday the Commission said it wants platforms to establish “clear marking systems and rules for bots” in order to ensure “their activities cannot be confused with human interactions”. It does not go into a greater level of detail on how that might be achieved. Clearly it’s intending platforms to have to come up with relevant methodologies. Identifying bots is not an exact science — as academics conducting research into how information spreads online could tell you. The current tools that exist for trying to spot bots typically involve rating accounts across a range of criteria to give a score of how likely an account is to be algorithmically controlled vs human controlled. But platforms do at least have a perfect view into their own systems, whereas academics have had to rely on the variable level of access platforms are willing to give them. Another factor here is that given the sophisticated nature of some online disinformation campaigns — the state-sponsored and heavily resourced efforts by Kremlin backed entities such as Russia’s Internet Research Agency, for example — if the focus ends up being algorithmically controlled bots vs IDing bots that might have human agents helping or controlling them, plenty of more insidious disinformation agents could easily slip through the cracks. That said, other measures in the EC’s proposals for platforms include stepping up their existing efforts to shutter fake accounts and being able to demonstrate the “effectiveness” of such efforts — so greater transparency around how fake accounts are identified and the proportion being removed (which could help surface more sophisticated human-controlled bot activity on platforms too). Another measure from the package: The EC says it wants to see “significantly” improved scrutiny of ad placements — with a focus on trying to reduce revenue opportunities for disinformation purveyors. Restricting targeting options for political advertising is another component. “Ensure transparency about sponsored content relating to electoral and policy-making processes,” is one of the listed objectives on its fact sheet — and ad transparency is something Facebook has said it’s prioritizing since revelations about the extent of Kremlin disinformation on its platform during the 2016 US presidential election, with expanded tools due this summer. The Commission also says generally that it wants platforms to provide “greater clarity about the functioning of algorithms” and enable third-party verification — though there’s no greater level of detail being provided at this point to indicate how much algorithmic accountability it’s after from platforms. We’ve asked for more on its thinking here and will update this story with any response. It looks to be seeking to test the water to see how much of the workings of platforms’ algorithmic blackboxes can be coaxed from them voluntarily — such as via measures targeting bots and fake accounts — in an attempt to stave off formal and more fulsome regulations down the line. Filter bubbles also appear to be informing the Commission’s thinking, as it says it wants platforms to make it easier for users to “discover and access different news sources representing alternative viewpoints” — via tools that let users customize and interact with the online experience to “facilitate content discovery and access to different news sources”. Though another stated objective is for platforms to “improve access to trustworthy information” — so there are questions about how those two aims can be balanced, i.e. without efforts towards one undermining the other. On trustworthiness, the EC says it wants platforms to help users assess whether content is reliable using “indicators of the trustworthiness of content sources”, as well as by providing “easily accessible tools to report disinformation”. In one of several steps Facebook has taken since 2016 to try to tackle the problem of fake content being spread on its platform the company experimented with putting ‘disputed’ labels or red flags on potentially untrustworthy information. However the company discontinued this in December after research suggested negative labels could entrench deeply held beliefs, rather than helping to debunk fake stories. Instead it started showing related stories — containing content it had verified as coming from news outlets its network of fact checkers considered reputable — as an alternative way to debunk potential fakes. The Commission’s approach looks to be aligning with Facebook’s rethought approach — with the subjective question of how to make judgements on what is (and therefore what isn’t) a trustworthy source likely being handed off to third parties, given that another strand of the code is focused on “enabling fact-checkers, researchers and public authorities to continuously monitor online disinformation”. Since 2016 Facebook has been leaning heavily on a network of local third party ‘partner’ fact-checkers to help identify and mitigate the spread of fakes in different markets — including checkers for written content and also photos and videos, the latter in an effort to combat fake memes before they have a chance to go viral and skew perceptions. In parallel Google has also been working with external fact checkers, such as on initiatives such as highlighting fact-checked articles in Google News and search. The Commission clearly approves of the companies reaching out to a wider network of third party experts. But it is also encouraging work on innovative tech-powered fixes to the complex problem of disinformation — describing AI (“subject to appropriate human oversight”) as set to play a “crucial” role for “verifying, identifying and tagging disinformation”, and pointing to blockchain as having promise for content validation. Specifically it reckons blockchain technology could play a role by, for instance, being combined with the use of “trustworthy electronic identification, authentication and verified pseudonyms” to preserve the integrity of content and validate “information and/or its sources, enable transparency and traceability, and promote trust in news displayed on the Internet”. It’s one of a handful of nascent technologies the executive flags as potentially useful for fighting fake news, and whose development it says it intends to support via an existing EU research funding vehicle: The Horizon 2020 Work Program. It says it will use this program to support research activities on “tools and technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain that can contribute to a better online space, increasing cybersecurity and trust in online services”. It also flags “cognitive algorithms that handle contextually-relevant information, including the accuracy and the quality of data sources” as a promising tech to “improve the relevance and reliability of search results”. The Commission is giving platforms until July to develop and apply the Code of Practice — and is using the possibility that it could still draw up new laws if it feels the voluntary measures fail as a mechanism to encourage companies to put the sweat in. It is also proposing a range of other measures to tackle the online disinformation issue — including: An independent European network of fact-checkers: The Commission says this will establish “common working methods, exchange best practices, and work to achieve the broadest possible coverage of factual corrections across the EU”; and says they will be selected from the EU members of the International Fact Checking Network which it notes follows “a strict International Fact Checking NetworkCode of Principles” The Commission says this will establish “common working methods, exchange best practices, and work to achieve the broadest possible coverage of factual corrections across the EU”; and says they will be selected from the EU members of the International Fact Checking Network which it notes follows “a strict International Fact Checking NetworkCode of Principles” A secure European online platform on disinformation to support the network of fact-checkers and relevant academic researchers with “cross-border data collection and analysis”, as well as benefitting from access to EU-wide data to support the network of fact-checkers and relevant academic researchers with “cross-border data collection and analysis”, as well as benefitting from access to EU-wide data Enhancing media literacy: On this it says a higher level of media literacy will “help Europeans to identify online disinformation and approach online content with a critical eye”. So it says it will encourage fact-checkers and civil society organisations to provide educational material to schools and educators, and organise a European Week of Media Literacy On this it says a higher level of media literacy will “help Europeans to identify online disinformation and approach online content with a critical eye”.

The Commission says it will launch a call for proposals in 2018 for “the production and dissemination of quality news content on EU affairs through data-driven news media” It says it will aim to co-ordinate its strategic comms policy to try to counter “false narratives about Europe” — which makes you wonder whether debunking the output of certain UK tabloid newspapers might fall under that new EC strategy — and also more broadly to tackle disinformation “within and outside the EU”. Commenting on the proposals in a statement, the Commission’s VP for the Digital Single Market, Andrus Ansip, said: “Disinformation is not new as an instrument of political influence. New technologies, especially digital, have expanded its reach via the online environment to undermine our democracy and society. Since online trust is easy to break but difficult to rebuild, industry needs to work together with us on this issue. Online platforms have an important role to play in fighting disinformation campaigns organised by individuals and countries who aim to threaten our democracy.” The EC’s next steps now will be bringing the relevant parties together — including platforms, the ad industry and “major advertisers” — in a forum to work on greasing cooperation and getting them to apply themselves to what are still, at this stage, voluntary measures. “The forum’s first output should be an EU wide Code of Practice on Disinformation to be published by July 2018, with a view to having a measurable impact by October 2018,” says the Commission. The first progress report will be published in December 2018. “The report will also examine the need for further action to ensure the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the outlined actions,” it warns. And if self-regulation fails… In a fact sheet further fleshing out its plans, the Commission states: “Should the self-regulatory approach fail, the Commission may propose further actions, including regulatory ones targeted at a few platforms.” And for “a few” read: Mainstream social platforms — so likely the big tech players in the social digital arena: Facebook, Google, Twitter. For potential regulatory actions tech giants only need look to Germany, where a 2017 social media hate speech law has introduced fines of up to 50M for platforms that fail to comply with valid takedown requests within 24 hours for simple cases, for an example of the kind of scary EU-wide law that could come rushing down the pipe at them if the Commission and EU states decide its necessary to legislate. Though justice and consumer affairs commissioner, Vera Jourova, signaled in January that her preference on hate speech at least was to continue pursuing the voluntary approach — though she also said some Member State’s ministers are open to a new EU-level law should the voluntary approach fail. In Germany the so-called NetzDG law has faced criticism for pushing platforms towards risk aversion-based censorship of online content. And the Commission is clearly keen to avoid such charges being leveled at its proposals, stressing that if regulation were to be deemed necessary “such [regulatory] actions should in any case strictly respect freedom of expression”. Commenting on the Code of Practice proposals, a Facebook spokesperson told us: People want accurate information on Facebook and that s what we want too. We have invested in heavily in fighting false news on Facebook by disrupting the economic incentives for the spread of false news, building new products and working with third-party fact checkers. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on the Commission’s proposals but flagged contributions he said the company is already making to support media literacy — including an event last week at its EMEA HQ. At the time of writing Google had not responded to a request for comment. Last month the Commission did further tighten the screw on platforms over terrorist content specifically — saying it wants them to get this taken down within an hour of a report as a general rule. Though it still hasn’t taken the step to cement that hour ‘rule’ into legislation, also preferring to see how much action it can voluntarily squeeze out of platforms via a self-regulation route.\n",

      "At some point in the future, while riding along in a car, a kid may ask their parent about a distant time in the past when people used steering wheels and pedals to control an automobile. Of course, the full realization of the auto part of the word in the form of fully autonomous automobiles is a long way off, but there are nonetheless companies trying to build that future today. However, changing the face of transportation is a costly business, one that typically requires corporate backing or a lot of venture funding to realize such an ambitious goal. A recent funding round, some $128 million raised in a Series A round by Shenzhen-based Roadstar.ai, got us at Crunchbase News asking a question: Just how many independent, well-funded autonomous vehicles startups are out there? In short, not as many as you d think. To investigate further, we took a look at the set of independent companies in Crunchbase s autonomous vehicle category that have raised $50 million or more in venture funding. After a little bit of hand filtering, we found that the companies mostly shook out into two broad categories: those working on sensor technologies, which are integral to any self-driving system, and more full-stack hardware and software companies, which incorporate sensors, machine-learned software models and control mechanics into more integrated autonomous systems. Full-stack self-driving vehicle companies Let s start with full-stack companies first. The table below shows the set of independent full-stack autonomous vehicle companies operating in the market today, as well as their focus areas, headquarter’s location and the total amount of venture funding raised: Note the breakdown in focus area between the companies listed above. In general, these companies are focused on building more generalized technology platforms perhaps to sell or license to major automakers in the future whereas others intend to own not just the autonomous car technology, but deploy it in a fleet of on-demand taxi and other transportation services. Making the eyes and ears of autonomous vehicles On the sensor side, there is also a trend, one that s decidedly more concentrated on one area of focus, as you ll be able to discern from the table below: Some of the most well-funded startups in the sensing field are developing light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technologies, which basically serve as the depth-perceiving eyes of autonomous vehicle systems. CYNGN integrates a number of different sensors, LiDAR included, into its hardware arrays and software tools, which is one heck of a pivot for the mobile phone OS-maker formerly known as Cyanogen. But there are other problem spaces for these sensor companies, including Nauto s smart dashcam, which gathers location data and detects distracted driving, or Autotalks s DSRC technology for vehicle-to-vehicle communication. (Back in April, Crunchbase News covered the $5 million Series A round closed by Comma, which released an open-source dashcam app.) And unlike some of the full-stack providers mentioned earlier, many of these sensor companies have established vendor relationships with the automotive industry. Quanergy Systems, for example, counts components giant Delphi, luxury carmakers Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz and automakers like Hyundai and Renault-Nissan as partners and investors. Innoviz supplies its solid-state LiDAR technology to the BMW Group, according to its website. Although radar and even LiDAR are old hat by now, there continues to be innovation in sensors. According to a profile of Oryx Vision s technology in IEEE Spectrum, its coherent optical radar system is kind of like a hybrid of radar and LiDAR technology in that it uses a laser to illuminate the road ahead [with infrared light], but like a radar it treats the reflected signal as a wave rather than a particle. Its technology is able to deliver higher-resolution sensing over a longer distance than traditional radar or newer LiDAR technologies. Can startups stack up against big corporate competitors? There are plenty of autonomous vehicle initiatives backed by deep corporate pockets. There s Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, which is subsidized by the huge amount of search profit flung off by Google . Uber has an autonomous vehicles initiative too, although it has encountered a whole host of legal and safety issues, including holding the unfortunate distinction of being the first to kill a pedestrian earlier this year. Tesla, too, has invested considerable resources into developing assistive technologies for its vehicles, but it too has encountered some roadblocks as its head of Autopilot (its in-house autonomy solution) left in April. The company also deals with a rash of safety concerns of its own. And although Apple s self-driving car program has been less publicized than others, it continues to roll on in the background. Chinese companies like Baidu and Didi Chuxing have also launched fill-stack R&D facilities in Silicon Valley. Traditional automakers have also jumped into the fray. Back in 2016, for the price of a cool $1 billion, General Motors folded Cruise Automation into its R&D efforts in a widely publicized buyout. And, not to be left behind, Ford acquired a majority stake in Argo AI, also for $1 billion. That leaves us with a question: Do even the well-funded startups mentioned earlier stand a chance of either usurping market dominance from corporate incumbents or at least joining their ranks? Perhaps. The reason why so much investor cash is going to these companies is because the market opportunity presented by autonomous vehicle technology is almost comically enormous. It s not just a matter of the car market itself projected to be over 80 million car sales globally in 2018 alone but how we ll spend all the time and mental bandwidth freed up by letting computers take the wheel. It s no wonder that so many companies, and their backers, want even a tiny piece of that pie.\n",

      "CancerAid, a self-reporting and symptom monitoring tool for cancer patients, has scored its first major coup in the U.S. healthcare market with its integration into Epic Systems electronic health records at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles and an integration with Apple’s HealthKit. Cedars, an investor in the company through an accelerator program it ran in conjunction with Techstars, marks the first U.S. hospital system to incorporate CancerAid’s self-reporting information into a dashboard system for doctors. It’s been a long road for company co-founders Raghav Murali-Ganesh and Nikhil Pooviah, who first met eight years ago at the Chris O’Brien Lifehouse, a Sydney, Australia cancer treatment center. Pooviah was a resident working with Murali-Ganesh in radiation oncology, positions the two men occupied for several years before venturing off on their own to launch the service that would become CancerAid. The company’s initial inspiration came from years spent checking out the tools that were already in the market for cancer patients — tools like Chemo Calendar that helped with things like scheduling and monitoring appointments. Instead of studying for some particularly tricky upcoming exams, Pooviah was spending time developing a patient-facing self-reporting symptom tracker and a community portal for cancer patients to discuss, share and monitor their own symptoms. It was that first tool that won the company acceptance into the Cedars Sinai accelerator and a competitive position in TechCrunch’s inaugural Startup Battlefield competition in Sydney, Australia. From its initial development, CancerAid now has four primary functions. On the patient side, there’s personalized cancer information for patients after their initial diagnosis. The company also provides a personal journal and symptom journal for patients to report on how they’re feeling, both emotionally and physically, as they progress through their treatment. A feature the company calls “Champions” was added so that family and friends could keep up with patients and encourage them. And finally, the company added a social networking feature so patients could connect with a broader community of patients and survivors. Now, the company has added “ClinicianLink,” a clinician-facing dashboard that sits in Epic and integrates with the existing workflows of nurses, oncologists, radiologists and the rest of the hospital administration and operational staff that touches patients as they undergo treatment. The company expects to lock in six-figure licensing deals for hospital systems to access the entire toolkit and offer it to patients. For hospitals, there’s some research that suggests simply by reporting their symptoms patients can improve their own outcomes, because doctors have a better sense on more regular intervals of the potential problems their patients face, the company said. “Patients will be able to use the patient-facing app at home, with a feedback loop back to their care team (physicians, nurses) in the hospital in real-time,” wrote Pooviah in an email. “This feedback loop helps reduce [emergency room] visits and 30 day readmissions (saving $19,000 per patient per year).” Beyond the Epic integration, CancerAid is also integrating with HealthKit — so that Apple wearables will be able to have the CancerAid functionality, the company said. The company has 20,000 patients on the app already, and is being used in 80 of the 200 largest U.S. health systems, according to Pooviah. Backed by $1.9 million in funding from strategic and financial investors, including Cedars-Sinai Health System, Techstars, Australia’s Shark Tank, Slingshot Ventures and Artesian Capital, the company is looking to expand in the U.S. through a dedicated subsidiary as it concentrates on one of the world’s largest healthcare markets.\n",

      "It seems clear that Niantic always had broader plans than simple casual gaming. The Google-supported startup s 2016 title Pok mon GO is largely considered a major factor in helping to mainstream augmented reality technology. Now the company is looking to take things a step further, tapping its massive user base to help build some large-scale AR maps. The plan was first reported by Reuters this morning, courtesy of a conversation with Niantic CEO John Hanke. The executive told the service, We want players to build out the game board they want to play on, adding that the world building would foster a new kind of social activity. There s no timeline for any of this. And it s not entirely clear whether the mapping will be output from Pok mon or the company s eagerly anticipated followup, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. What is clear, however, is that the company plans to start in public spaces like parks, utilizing AR tech built by recent acquisition, Escher Reality. The plan here is to build a larger platform that can be utilized by third parties. It s a feature that s only likely to grow in demand as major mobile players like Apple and Google push developers to build AR apps through initiatives like ARKit and ARCore. Google, which has supported the company since its earliest days, has been reasserting its commitment to augmented reality this week at Google I/O through offerings like the upcoming walking navigation in Maps.\n",

      "Attic Labs, the creator of Noms, an open-source decentralized database, announced today that is being acquired by Salesforce. Terms of the deal, Salesforce s first acquisition of 2018, were undisclosed. Last year, the company only bought digital creative agency Sequence, according to Crunchbase, taking a break from an acquisition spree in 2016 when it snapped up a dozen companies. Noms was launched in August 2016, at the same time Attic Labs announced it had raised an $8.1 million Series A round led by Greylock. Founders Aaron Boodman and Rafael Weinstein, along with many other members of Attic Labs team, previously worked on Google Chrome. Boodman also created Greasemonkey. Like Git, Noms lets users replicated data and edit it offline on multiple machines, then syncs up the edits. It also emphasizes versioning so edits don t destroy previous versions of data, making it easier to retrieve if necessary. Unlike Git, however, Noms is written to store structured data instead of text files and support very large data sets. In its announcement, Attic Labs said Noms will remain open source. In a Noms forum post, Boodman added that Attic Labs has no immediate plans for additional work on the database. After the acquisition is completed, Attic Labs team will join Quip, the document collaboration platform Salesforce bought in August 2016 for $750 million. Attic Labs said Noms tech will extend Quip s ability to connect live data sources, making it easier for people to collaborate faster and more effectively.

      "Uberall, the Berlin-headquartered startup that has developed a cloud-based platform to let small and large businesses get listed and market themselves across multiple location-based services, has picked up $25 million in Series B funding. Leading the round is HPE Growth Capital, who join existing investors that include Project A, and United Internet. The company says it will use the new capital for product development and international expansion, including a focus on the U.S. where Uberall already has an office in San Francisco. Founded in 2013 by David Federhen, Florian H bner, and Josha Benner, Uberall offers a Software-as-a-Service for SMEs and larger companies (who have multiple stores) to manage their various location marketing across all of the various platforms, from search and directories, to maps and sat-nav. In a call with Uberall co-CEO H bner, he said this includes getting your shop or store listed on all of the supported services via a single submission and control centre. This spans search engines and local directories such as Google, Where To?, Scoot, 192, Opendi, and Hotfrog, and online maps such as Bing, Google Maps, HERE (ex. Nokia) and Apple Maps. Social products that have a location element are also supported, including Facebook, Foursquare, Yelp, and Instagram. As are Navigation services, such as Uber, Waze, and in-car sat navs (mostly powered through HERE), Navmii, and TomTom. To manage all of these individually is a lot of work and prohibitively time consuming, which is the first problem Uberall set out to solve. This also includes helping to inject as much structured data as possible into each of the 100 or so supported services e.g. location, opening times, menu items, facilities etc., which is non-trivial since there isn t a standard format for all data. However, explained H bner, beyond listing a business, the SaaS has since developed to be a full suite of location marketing features that also supports managing engagement in the form of reviews and ratings including, most importantly, responding to customer feedback, which also contributes to how prominently a business is listed. And once you ve got your business properly listed and are able to manage your presence, Uberall has a location-based advertising product, too. This sees placing location-based adds made a lot easier, especially for smaller businesses who don t have a budget to employ a campaign manager or it wouldn t be cost effective in terms of ROI to do so. In other words, come to Uberall for the listings and engagement management and stay for the location-based advertising. The startup charges a per month fee per business location. To date, Uberall says it counts a range of well-known clients from different industries as customers, including Domino s, DHL Group, Vodafone, IHG, Deutsche Telekom, Thyssenkrupp, HUK Coburg, and Douglas. In addition, the SaaS is being used by SMEs, increasingly via the distribution partnerships it has with 1&1 Internet, Swisscom, Sensis, Vendasta, and OVH.\n",

      "If you ve tried selling your old smartphone on a refurbishment website, chances are you ended up with a dozen browser tabs comparing prices. French startup Back Market is taking advantage of this fragmented industry to create a marketplace and aggregate all refurbishers on a single online platform. The startup just raised $48 million ( 41 million). Groupe Arnault, Eurazeo, Agla Ventures and Daphni participated in today s funding round. Back in May, the company told me that it was working with over 270 factories. Back Market has generated over $110 million in gross merchandise volume over the past three years. The service is now live in France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and Italy. The company just expanded to the U.S. Before, refurbishment was just a thing for tech savvy people and tech bloggers, co-founder and chief creative officer Vianney Vaute told me. With Back Market, it becomes a mainstream alternative. Working with multiple factories is also a competitive advantage when it comes to pricing, fail rate and quality assurance. Back Market has an overview on the industry and can choose to work with some partners and leave underperforming ones behind. The startup needs to build a brand that consumers can trust. While smartphones and laptops are the most prominent products on the homepage, Back Market also accepts game consoles, TVs, headphones, coffee machines and more. Back Market also sells Apple products refurbished by Apple itself. Now that smartphones have become a mature market, many customers aren t looking for new and shiny devices. Some customers can be perfectly happy with a phone that was released last year or two years ago. It represents an opportunity for Back Market and the refurbishment industry as a whole.\n",

      "As Uber works on trying to find a more profitable path ahead for its transportation-on-demand service, it has sold off one of its units that sat peripherally to that business. Fair, the car leasing startup that announced debt and equity funding of up to $1 billion in October, has acquired the active leasing portfolio of Xchange Leasing, a service Uber first established in 2015 to lease new and nearly-new vehicles to drivers who did not come to the service with their own cars. The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, Fair s co-founder and CEO Scott Painter told TechCrunch in an interview. In December, there were reports that a deal was in the works between the two after Uber decided to wind down the operation. Those reports claimed Xchange s book value for its fleet of 30,000 cars was around $400 million, a figure that Painter did not dispute. As part of the sale, Fair becomes Uber s exclusive partner for leasing services for its drivers in the U.S. who want to lease cars for 30 days or more. Fair also has a direct-to-consumer business and that will continue alongside the deal, but Fair will not be entering into more partnerships with other transportation-on-demand companies that compete with Uber in the U.S.. Uber is big enough for us for now, Painter said. There were reports that Uber was losing around $9,000 per car on the service putting a strain on the company s attempt to stem its losses and build a more financially sustainable business. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber s new CEO, has set a goal of making the company profitable in the next three years. The outsized transportation startup has now raised $22.2 billion and is now valued at $48 billion, but it s been pumping that funding into very aggressive expansion plans that have included passenger and driver acquisition subsidies, fighting regulatory battles, R&D and other costly efforts. It s not an unrealistic goal much smaller transportation companies have been close to or are already in the black. Now the idea is, as the British like to say, horses for courses. Uber will focus on its transportation service and building better relationships with those in its two-sided marketplace of drivers and passengers, while Fair will take on the leasing operation. As we progress on our mission to deliver better experiences for drivers, Uber is excited to partner with companies like Fair that have deep domain expertise and innovative solutions, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a statement. We look forward to working closely with Fair to develop thoughtful, customized options for drivers in the U.S. On the side of Fair, it will be interesting to see how Fair manages the economics of a business that did not prove to be financially fruitful for Uber. Painter argues that in its favor, Fair is only working on leasing services (for now; there will be purchasing options added over time) and has optimised its platform to fit the economics of this model. It s an emerging area of the transportation industry, and one that automakers might also look to get involved in more directly, bypassing the traditional companies involved in renting vehicles, judging by recent moves from Ford and GM. Car ownership is changing, said Painter, a familiar refrain in the automotive world today. The plan for Fair which is backed by strategic investors that include Penske and BMW is to be one of the companies at the center of how cars will be used by consumers in that future. This isn t a completely left-field idea. Even if the price of autonomous and other next-generation cars comes down over time, there are many in the automotive market who question whether they will ever be as affordable to the mass market as cars are today. Still to come will be what the two plan to do outside the U.S., where Fair has yet to expand but wants to. International markets are definitely in our plans, he said, noting that existing regulations for leasing in places like Europe will make entry relatively painless. This could potentially involve expanding its relationship with Uber, or using international markets to work out partnerships with others in the space, given that Uber is not always the dominant player in every country. From what we understand, Fair has also secured and closed more funding, but Painter declined to talk about that in our interview. However, that funding could, in part, be used for an international push. Fair s existing business model is predicated on the idea of an all-in service, where customers monthly fee for leasing a vehicle also includes maintenance and some roadside assistance, with the option also of purchasing insurance through the platform, both to protect the driver and protect our assets. This is the company s first acquisition, after a deal early in its life fell through to buy the assets of failed car selling and buying app Beepi. It s not clear how many staff from Xchange Leasing will be joining Fair as part of this deal. There were 500 employees working in the unit under Uber, and reports in December alleged that the number going to Fair will be around 150. Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n",

      "Workday, the cloud-based platform that offers HR and other back-office apps for businesses, is making an acquisition to expand its portfolio of services: it’s buying Adaptive Insights, a provider of cloud-based business planning and financial modelling tools, for $1.55 billion. The acquisition is notable because Adaptive Insights had filed for an IPO as recently as May 17. Workday says that the $1.55 billion price tag includes “the assumption of approximately $150 million in unvested equity issued to Adaptive Insights employees” related to that IPO. This deal is expected to close in Q3 of this year. IPO filings are known to sometimes trigger M&A. Most recently, PayPal announced it would acquire iZettle just after the latter filed to go public. Skype was acquired by Microsoft in 2011 while it was waiting to IPO after previous owner eBay said it would spin it off. Workday itself went public in 2012 and currently has a market cap of nearly $27 billion. The deal will give Workday another string to its bow, in its attempt to become the go-to place for all for back-office services for its business customers: the company plans to integrate Adaptive Insights’ tools into its existing platform. Adaptive Insights is an industry leader with its Business Planning Cloud platform, and together with Workday, we will help customers accelerate their finance transformation in the cloud,” said Aneel Bhusri, Co-Founder and CEO, Workday, in a statement. I am excited to welcome the Adaptive Insights team to Workday and look forward to coming together to continue delivering industry-leading products that equip finance organizations to make even faster, better business decisions to adapt to change and to drive growth. The two have been working together as partners since 2015. In the case Adaptive Insights, which says it has ‘thousands’ of customers, its growth mirrors that both of cloud services and specifically about how business intelligence has developed into a distinct software category of its own over the years, with not just the CFO but an army of in-house analysts relying on analytics of a business’ data to help make small and big decisions. The market opportunity here is huge as the CFO has become a power player in the C-Suite, CEO Tom Bogan told TechCrunch when it raised $75 million in 2015, when it first passed the billion-dollar mark for its valuation. Bogan previously also held a role as chairman of Citrix. As a former CFO myself, I have seen this first hand and it is accelerating.” Other examples of this force includes Twitter s Anthony Noto catapulting from CFO to COO (and is now a CEO running SoFi). Around 25 percent of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are former CFOs. Adaptive Insights had raised $175 million prior to this. Bogan will stay on and lead the business and report directly to Bhusri. Joining forces with Workday accelerates our vision to drive holistic business planning and digital transformation for our customers, said Bogan, in a separate statement. Most importantly, both Adaptive Insights and Workday have an employee-first and customer-centric approach to developing enterprise software that will only increase the power of the combined companies. More generally, while we have certainly seen a much wider opening of the door for tech IPOs this year, there is also an argument to be made for continuing consolidation it enterprise IT, in particular with regards to cloud services that might have small or potentially negative margins. Adaptive Insights was not immune to that: the company in its public listing filing said that its previous fiscal year brough tin $106.5 million in revenues, up 30 percent from the year before, but it also posted a loss of $42.7 million in the same period. That was narrower than the $59.1 million it posted in 2016. Combined with the bigger trend of all-in-one platforms packing a bigger punch with businesses, it might have meant that Workday’s offer was too compelling to refuse. This looks like Workday’s biggest acquisition yet, but the company has been on a spree of sorts: just last week it announced the acquisition of RallyTeam to beef up its machine learning.\n",

      "Goodlord, the London proptech startup that has built a software platform to handle transactions and the paperwork normally associated with renting a home, has laid off nearly 40 employees, while TechCrunch understands from sources that co-founder and CEO Richard White will soon be leaving the company. The job losses are said to be in sales and marketing, and come just nine months after Goodlord announced 7.2 million in funding led by Rocket Internet s GFC. LocalGlobe and Ribbit Capital also participated in the Series A round. Regarding White s pending departure, it is not clear if a new CEO has already been lined up. I have also been unable to confirm if Goodlord CTO Andrew Done remains at the startup, although it is possible that he has already departed. I ve asked Goodlord for further details but a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on any changes in leadership, expect to say that White is still the CEO. In a call, co-founder and COO Tom Mundy also declined to comment further. However, I stand by my reporting and expect an official announcement to be issued in due course. On the sales and marketing downsizing, which was first reported by website Property Industry Eye, Goodlord has issued the following statement: We have had great success during 2017 bringing new lettings agents onto the platform, however, to focus on scaling effectively and efficiently we have reduced the size of our sales and marketing team and are putting more focus on bringing out new features and automation functionality to the platform. Our customers will see the effects of this focus almost immediately with new features and services being released as soon as the end of the month. To reflect the increased emphasis on product and technology we restructured the business and following a consultation period we reduced the number of employees from 134 to 96. All affected employees have benefited from an extended paid notice period and have been offered as much support as possible to help them find their next big thing. To ensure we offer the very best platform we can, we have a number of positions open for extremely talented product and engineering staff. We remain focused on building a business with superior technology and outstanding customer service and our letting agent customers will see no change in the levels of service we offer them. Founded in 2014, unlike other startups in the rental market space that want to essentially destroy traditional brick n mortar letting agents with an online equivalent, Goodlord s Software-as-a-Service is designed to support all stakeholders, including traditional high-street letting agents, as well as landlords and, of course, tenants. The Goodlord SaaS enables letting agents to digitize the moving-in process, including utilizing e-signatures and collecting rental payments online. In addition, the company sells landlord insurance, and has been working on other related products, such as rental guarantees, and tenant passports. The latter means that, if Goodlord reaches scale, it wants to let tenants easily take their rental transaction history and landlord references with them when moving from one rental property to another as proof that they are a trustworthy tenant. The idea of offering Generation Rent a portable profile with built in trust is also being potentially pursued by other startups, such as Acasa, which focuses on utilities and other shared household expenditure.\n",

      "Sweden’s Instabridge, the Wi-Fi sharing community and mobile app that has proved particularly popular in Brazil and Mexico, has scored $3 million in further funding — money it’s pegged for Asia expansion, starting with India. The new round is led by Luminar Ventures (headed up by Magnus Bergman and Jacob Key), with participation from previous backers Balderton Capital, Draper Associates, Moor, and Creandum. The company had previously raised around $5 million. Originally founded in late 2012 as a way to enable you to share your home Wi-Fi with friends on Facebook, the Stockholm-based company has since pivoted to become a broader Wi-Fi sharing community, and has found traction in developing markets where cellular data remains prohibitively expensive. The Instabridge app lets you share the details of any Wi-Fi hotspot with other Instabridge users, and provides access to Wi-Fi hotspots shared by everyone else in the community. This has enabled it to build a crowdsourced database of Wi-Fi hotspots, in addition to a list of known public venues that have free Wi-Fi, such as McDonald s or Starbucks. Instabridge says it plans to build on the traction it has seen in South America by targeting India’s population of over 1 billion people, of which it says only 400 million currently have internet access. This, Instabridge co-founder Niklas Agevik tells me, will include building out a team in India, and plays into the company’s new-found mission of expanding internet access in developing countries where internet services remain relatively expensive and yet access to the internet is a proven means of “reducing income inequality”. Meanwhile, I’m told that Instabridge is now seeing 2.3 million Monthly Active Users, and is growing at a rate of 50,000 new users per day. The Instabridge database now houses the details of 2 million Wi-Fi spots.\n",

      "Google is back investing in ride-hailing companies. The U.S. search firm and China s Meituan-Dianping are among the tech giants set to invest in Go-Jek, the Indonesia-based rival to Grab and Uber, a source with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. We understand a deal could be completed as soon as next week, though whether Go-Jek announces it is unclear since it has history of not disclosing new investments. Reuters reports that round is worth $1.2 billion, and we re hearing that is accurate but with a caveat. These new investors are part of a follow-on to an investment made last year, according to our source. Funding rounds are often complicated and not as clean as they may appear once announced. In Go-Jek s case, it secured investment from Chinese internet giant Tencent in March last year as an initial tranche of a planned $1.2 billion raise. Existing investors including KKR, Warburg Pincus, Sequoia Capital, Northstar Group, DST Global and NSI Ventures agreed to follow on and Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com joined later in the year, too, but an allocation was left open. Now that is full and the round is complete with commitments from Google, Temasek and Meituan-Dianping. We don t have confirmed numbers for those stakes but, as latecomers to the party, they are likely to be fairly small and strategic in nature. We understand the investment gives Go-Jek a valuation that is a touch above the $3 billion that Tencent agreed to invest at last year. Google declined to comment. Representatives from Go-Jek, Temasek and Meituan-Dianping did not respond to requests for comment. Go-Jek previously raised $550 million in 2016 so this is a big jump, but the competition has also increased its rounds by significant multiples. Singapore-based Grab has raised more than $4 billion to date, including a $2.5 billion round led by SoftBank and China s Didi Chuxing at a $6 billion valuation. Uber remains the world s highest funded private tech startup with over $20 billion from investors, including a recent cut-price valuation deal with SoftBank. Interestingly, our source confirmed that Google itself is investing directly rather than its Google Ventures unit. Just one month ago, Google made its first direct investment in India when it backed concierge app Dunzo. That, combined with the Go-Jek investment, indicates an increased interest in India and Indonesia, two of the world s most promising emerging markets for tech and consumer internet services, beyond the product work it is doing in both regions. It also adds another wrinkle to the complicated relationship of ride-hailing companies worldwide. Google Ventures invested in Uber in 2013 and, after a legal suit caused the relationship to get frosty, it backed Lyft last year. Meituan-Dianping, meanwhile, may not be well known in the west but it is another significant addition. The company was formed through a merger between China s top two local commerce platforms and is valued at $30 billion. Beyond providing a platform that lets physical retail stores tap the internet for business, it is aggressively moving into ride-sharing in China where it hopes to rival Didi thanks to a $4 billion investment that closed last year. A foray into Southeast Asia through Go-Jek makes sense in that context, but Meituan-Dianping may also look to work with Go-Jek to expand its core service known as offline-to-online in Indonesia, which is the world s fourth most populous country with over 250 million people. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said Southeast Asia is unprofitable, but the region which is home to 600 million consumers is tipped to see huge growth. Ride-hailing in the region is predicted to become a $20.1 billion per year industry by 2025 up from $5.1 billion in 2017, according to a report co-authored by Google. With Southeast Asia s largest economy, Indonesia is likely to account for the majority of that a prior 2015 Google-affiliated report pegging its share of revenue at more than 40 percent. (You can t accuse Google of not doing its homework.) Go-Jek itself was founded in 2011 and it began to make a name for itself a few years ago through its core motorbike tax on-demand service. Bike taxis already exist in many of Southeast Asia s largest cities where they are popular options for cutting through congested streets and getting from A to B faster than four wheels. Go-Jek has since expanded to offer regular taxis, services and shopping on-demand and a mobile payment service, which is being pushed as an offline option too. Its core office is in Jakarta but it has an engineering presence in India. The company is widely thought to be ahead of Grab and Uber in Indonesia, which remains its only market. Uber and Grab both offer similar motorbike taxi options in parts of Southeast Asia, while Grab has also ventured into the mobile payment space. Yesterday, it completed its second acquisition to boost its GrabPay service. Featured Image: BAY ISMOYO/Getty Images\n",

      "500 Startups may soon be coming up on the one-year mark for the end of a tumultuous saga involving its founder, but its accelerator classes still continue to plug along and its next batch is now getting ready to roll. The firm’s 23rd batch of startups this year consists of the usual mix of business to business and consumer companies (even coffee) that end up in each class. This class is definitely a smaller one, but it still seems to spread a pretty wide number of different verticals. There’s also, of course, a blockchain track for this class, though a small percentage of the startups in it are taking part of that and there was still a certain rigor they had to have to run through it. “For every major tech movement, for every tech phase, there’s the infrastructure phase and the deployment phase,” 500 Startups partner Marvin Laio said. “Our view, with the blockchain, we’re in the infrastructure phase. A lot of these projects outside that we see and read about, they’re kind of bad. They’re really applications. There’s no point having a mobile app if you don’t have the app store. You need to build out the app store. For better or worse, we’re in the infrastructure phase right now.” The firm is still clearly making some pretty big changes, including an unconventional deal with the Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG) that gives it a stake in the firm’s parent company. The terms of that deal weren’t disclosed, it was another move among many by CEO Christine Tsai to begin to rework the mechanics of how the firm works especially as it hopes to succeed as both a venture fund as as a program for entrepreneurs looking to get their companies off the ground. Dave McClure, the firm’s co-founder, resigned last year following allegations of sexual misconduct, and since then it’s been trying to get back to business as usual. 500 Startups takes a similar approach to other accelerators, where they will invest around $150,000 for a small chunk of equity and then take on a small amount of that back (a little more than $37,000) for program fees. The firm has primarily been known for its savvy when it comes to growth and marketing, so the support entrepreneurs get usually has that as a core part of the experience. Here’s the next batch of 500 Startups companies: Chipper A mobile app that helps student loan borrowers pay off debt faster through round ups from everyday transactions and contributions from family and friends.

      "Max Rhodes was walking around that weird little parklet in Hayes Valley in San Francisco after taking a break from a five-year stint at Square to figure out what he wanted to do next and he kept seeing Square registers everywhere. It was spotting them over and over again in smaller retail shops dotted throughout the city that made him think about the connections between the average product maker that kind of small group making a bespoke funny candle and those retailers. That s what prompted him to start Indigo Fair, a platform that connects those two entities in order to streamline the process of getting those products into smaller retail stores that are looking for just those kinds of weird candles throughout major urban areas. The company said it has raised $12 million in new financing from Forerunner Ventures and Khosla Ventures, with Forerunner s Kirsten Green joining the board of directors. I started to think about the fact that you have all these stores adopting cloud-based PoS systems and inventory systems and, generally all their data is becoming available through their media profiles and inventory systems, Rhodes said. If there were some way that you could get all that data and know what is selling where, you could actually predict how well a given product is gonna sell in a store. That was the starting point. As so-called big box shopping increasingly shifts online, the theory is that there will be more and more niche retail outlets looking for interesting products that try to capitalize on the core original shopping experience, which is more social and curated. Indigo Fair receives hundreds of applications from makers every week though, as more and more tools become available to create more complex products, that s probably only going to increase and the team accepts about 5 percent of those applications. Part of the reason is to keep a good handle on the company s growth and still make sure it has that curated feel for retailers, who know they are getting their hands on a good product. They send in some information and then start getting orders, print out a shipping label and then start sending the product out to those retailers. On the retailer end, the shops sign up and immediately have access to those products available through those wholesale makers. Indigo Fair aims to cut out the process of spending tens of thousands of dollars on trips to trade shows with makers to find the right products and then get them in their stores with the hope that they ll sell. If you go into one of the stores on Valencia Street in San Francisco, you ll probably find quite a bit of weird stuff that those stores hope to sell. Indigo Fair looks to try to streamline that process and make it easier to get those products in-house without all the travel and hassle. Of course, even using public data as a starting point, gathering the data to make the model defensible is the harder part. After all, there are a lot of online platforms looking to empower wholesale makers to get their goods into the hands of consumers, though the company today said it s actually partnering with Shopify and Square. But as the company gets more and more information about what s selling, what isn t and who s returning what, it gets a better sense of consumer demand for a product and where to put it to keep the cost for both of those entities down. In so many ways it s the age-old challenge of marketplaces, Green said. I think it requires you to be very scrappy, it requires you to find good customers that believe in the proposition and the potential for the product that they re willing to start working with you in that regard. There is a lot of info you can readily access online today. Just having the patience and the commitment to try to put a bunch of that together on your own platform so you can start building the data set is just some of the heavy lifting involved. Rhodes hope, amid increasing competition and different models and approaches like Simon which wants to help startups get pop-up shops in malls is that with his experience dealing with the problems first-hand, and with enough data, Indigo Fair will become a go-to service for both retailers and product makers. Rhodes, a former consultant at Bain who helped build Square Cash, with his co-founders Marcelo Cortes and Daniele Perito, look to lean on everyone s experience getting an expensive umbrella in stores and selling it across North America to enable every product maker to get the same thing done.\n",

      "Back in 2011, when South Korea won its longshot bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, the country wasn t widely recognized as a destination for ski and snow lovers. It wasn t considered much of a tech startup hub either. Fast forward seven years and a lot has changed. For the next 10 days, the eyes of the world will be on the snowy slopes of PyeongChang. Meanwhile, a couple of hours away in Seoul, a burgeoning startup scene is seeing investments multiply, generating exits and even creating a unicorn or two. While South Korea doesn t get a perfect score as a startup innovation hub, it has established itself as a serious contender. More than half a billion dollars annually has gone to seed through late-stage funding rounds for the past few years. During that time, at least two companies, e-commerce company Coupang and mobile-focused content and commerce company Yello Mobile, have established multi-billion-dollar valuations. To provide a broader picture of how South Korea stacks up in terms of attracting startup investment and building scalable companies, Crunchbase News put together a data dive looking at funding totals, significant investments, exits and active investors. Here are some of our findings. A fast rise Venture funding for South Korean startups started to take off in 2014, per Crunchbase data. Previously, venture funding rounds that made it into the database only totaled in the tens of millions of dollars annually. But about four years ago, the numbers started rising dramatically. In the chart below, we look at the annual totals from 2010 through 2018: Big, later-stage rounds pushed up the totals. In the past four years, more than two dozen companies have closed financings of $10 million or more, including a few unicorns for substantially larger sums. One of those, Coupang, has raised $1.4 billion from venture and private equity investors to date. Totals have trended lower in the past couple of years, which may be attributed to fewer giant rounds. For instance, more than half of the 2015 total came from a $1 billion SoftBank investment in Coupang. Emerging startups While totals are down some over the past few quarters, South Korean startups have continued to attract attention and big checks from both domestic and overseas investors. The largest single funding in the past year went to TMON (short for Ticket Monster), which raised $115 million last April at a reported $1.4 billion valuation. This is the second time scaling up with growth funding, as the Seoul-based company already provided an exit to early investors years ago. Coupon site LivingSocial bought the company in 2011, then sold itself to Groupon, which then spun out the Korean company. After TMON, the next-biggest funding rounds were for travel site Yanolja, which raised $55 million, and Snow, developer of popular selfie apps, which raised $50 million. In the chart below, we look at these and other significant financings from 2017 through today: The list of top funding recipients includes a mix of startups focused principally on the Korean market and those attracting a broad international user base. Companies focused on the domestic market find that Korea, with 50 million inhabitants and a highly urbanized, tech-savvy customer base, is big enough to support massively scalable businesses. Those in that camp include TMON and Coupang. But Korea also has a record of building up major global companies, like Samsung, LG and Hyundai, to name the best known. So it s not surprising to see companies with global ambitions among the top startups. In recent years, the leading Korean search engine, Naver, in particular, has been successful launching startups with global reach. The firm is a majority owner of the Japan-headquartered messaging app LINE, which went public last year and is valued at nearly $10 billion. Line and Naver are also majority owners of Snow. It s also possible to start local and later go global. In this camp is Viva Republica, a developer of a fast-growing mobile payments tool Toss, which got initial traction in Korea and is now setting its sights on expansion abroad. Playing to win Korea s startup scene is attracting a large and diverse collection of investors, including Korea-based funds, corporate VCs, Silicon Valley venture firms and others. A number of firms are repeat investors. Among the most active are Samsung, Altos Ventures, SoftBank Ventures Korea, Formation 8 (now Formation Group and 8VC), 500 Startups and Anchor Equity Partners. The total pool of investors is much deeper, however. Crunchbase data shows that more than 150 angel, seed, incubator and VC and corporate venture investors have participated in funding rounds for Korea-based companies over the past five years. Of course, not all recent bets on promising startups will turn out winners. But all in all, it appears that South Korean entrepreneurs have clearly put together a competitive lineup.

      "You don’t hear of many $2 loans in the United States, where $2 won’t buy you more than a chocolate bar. But in cities like Lagos, Nigeria, and Nairobi, Kenya, $2 has the buying power of roughly $40, making such “micro” loans useful when you’re running a small business. And borrowing $2 from a startup called Branch is a way onto a platform that promises much bigger loans, based on your credit worthiness. What is Branch and why is it bothering with such small amounts of money? For answers to those questions, we talked this week with its founder and CEO Matt Flannery, who previously cofounded and co-led Kiva, a now 14-year-old micro-lending platform that enables families to make small loans to entrepreneurs in developing countries. Flannery realized while running Kiva that a nonprofit — which Kiva is — can only get so far when it comes to fundraising. Meanwhile, fascinated by the spread of smart phones and digital payment systems in Africa, Flannery knew that if he could raise serious capital, he could make even more loans to small business owners without needing to meet and interview them first. In service to that idea, what Branch built is an app that analyzes all kinds of information on a user’s phone that determines how to score their credit. For example, in Nigeria, every time you use an ATM, the bank sends you an SMS message with your bank balance. That’s useful information to Branch. In Kenya, every time you pay your energy bill, the receipt comes via SMS. Knowing if you pay it and how big a bill you’re paying is valuable information, too. Users apparently don’t see the app as invading their privacy — or it’s worth the trade-off to them if they do. Since its 2015 founding, Branch has been downloaded onto more than one million mobile phones in Sub-Saharan Africa, says Flannery. Based on that momentum, Branch has attracted the kind of financial muscle Flannery was seeking when he left Kiva to start the company. In fact, Branch is announcing today that it has lined up $70 million in Series B funding to expand its financial offerings to additional countries, including India. Trinity Ventures led the $20 million equity portion of the round, along with participation from International Finance Corporation, Andreessen Horowitz and CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund. Branch also secured a $50 million debt facility from Victory Park Capital, an investment firm with a focus on alternative credit whose other portfolio companies include LendingClub and LendUp. Altogether, Branch has now raised $80 million. It suggests that lending incremental amounts isn’t just helpful to small business owners in developing countries; there’s a lucrative opportunity in it. “The banking infrastructure in the U.S. is so robust and complete,” says Schwark Satyavolu, the general partner at Trinity Ventures who led the round for his firm. Meanwhile, Branch, he says, “seems like an application of Silicon Valley tech to create financial services. But it’s substantially more interesting, because Branch is doing it in emerging markets where you don’t have a robust stack or credit bureaus or information that’s nearly as rich or as deep as in the Western world.” It’s worth noting that Branch is not a bank, despite that it calls itself a “branchless bank.” Its straightforward terms of use are just one giveaway. Branch charges 15 percent interest on a loan as low as $2 at the end of one month. It also charges a 15 percent APR on its largest loans, which are $1,000 and can be paid over a 12-month period. Branch basically loses money on the $2 loan in order to drum up repeat business — and the strategy is working, according to Flannery. New customers borrow from Branch 20 times on average in the first year after they’ve downloaded the app. If that sounds like a risky proposition for new borrowers, the good news, in our view, is that Branch never charges its users overdraft fees. “I’ve worked in microfinance long enough to know that late fees create a cycle of debt,” Flannery says. What investors like even more is that Branch — which has 100 employees in San Francisco, Lagos, and Nairobi — was profitable before taking on this new funding. It’s also growing 20 percent month over month, and it plans to roll out savings accounts next. “We see savings as a critical next step,” says Flannery. “People typically don’t have them, or the yield is super low to non-existent.” It will be a “big regulatory issue for us,” he says, explaining such accounts could be a year out, based on Branch’s dealings with the banks it needs as partners. It’s worth it, though, he adds. There’s a “big opportunity in these places.”\n",

      "Naspers, the South African tech and media conglomerate, continues to have an incredibly hot hand when it comes to global tech investment. Famous for owning a huge chunk of the Chinese Internet powerhouse, Tencent and a big chunk of Mail.ru, Naspers just made $2.2 billion off of the sale of Flipkart to Walmart. The South African company had an 11.18% stake in Flipkart and the sale represents an IRR of 32%, the company said. Naspers originally backed Flipkart five years after the company’s launch in 2007 and had invested roughly $616 million into the company since that time. Naspers said that proceeds from the sale of Flipkart would be funneled back into the company’s balance sheet to fuel the growth of the company’s own classifieds, online food delivery, and fintech businesses globally. With Flipkart out of the portfolio, Naspers still holds a huge chunk of online tech real estate in India. The company has stakes in PayU, a payment and fintech company; OLX, a classifieds business; the online travel business MakeMyTrip, and Swiggy, a food delivery company.\n",

      "A newly discovered set of vulnerabilities in AMD chips is making waves not because of the scale of the flaws, but rather the rushed, market-ready way in which they were disclosed by the researchers. When was the last time a bug had its own professionally shot video and PR rep, yet the company affected was only alerted 24 hours ahead of time? The flaws may be real, but the precedent set here is an unsavory one. The flaws in question were discovered by CTS Labs, a cybersecurity research outfit in Israel, and given a set of catchy names: Ryzenfall, Masterkey, Fallout and Chimera, with associated logos, a dedicated website and a whitepaper describing them. So far, so normal: major bugs like Heartbleed and of course Meltdown and Spectre got names and logos too. The difference is that in those cases the affected parties, such as Intel, the OpenSSL team and AMD were quietly alerted well ahead of time. This is the concept of “responsible disclosure,” and gives developers first crack at fixing an issue before it becomes public. There’s legitimate debate over just how much control big companies should exert over the publicity of their own shortcomings, but generally speaking in the interest of protecting users the convention tends to be adhered to. In this case, however, the CTS Labs team sprang their flaws on AMD fully formed and with little warning. The flaws discovered by the team are real, though they require administrative privileges to execute a cascade of actions, meaning taking advantage of them requires considerable access to the target system. The research describes some as backdoors deliberately included in the chips by Taiwanese company ASmedia, which partners with many manufacturers to produce components. The access requirement makes these much more limited than the likes of Meltdown and Spectre, which exploited problems at the memory handling and architecture level. They’re certainly serious, but the manner in which they have been publicized has aroused suspicion around the web. Why the extremely non-technical video shot on green screen with stock backgrounds composited in? Why the scare tactics of calling out AMD’s use in the military? Why don’t the bugs have CVE numbers, the standard tracking method for nearly all serious issues? Why was AMD given so little time to respond? Why not, if as the FAQ suggests, some fixes could be created in a matter of months, at least delay the publication until they were available? And what’s with the disclosure that CTS “may have, either directly or indirectly, an economic interest in the performance” of AMD? That’s not a common disclosure in situations like this. (I’ve contacted the PR representative listed for the flaws [!] for answers to some of these questions.) It’s hard to shake the idea that there’s some kind of grudge against AMD at play. That doesn’t make the flaws any less serious, but it does leave a bad taste in the mouth. AMD issued a statement saying that “We are investigating this report, which we just received, to understand the methodology and merit of the findings.” Hard to do much else in a day. As always with these big bugs, the true extent of their reach, how serious they really are, whether users or businesses will be affected and what they can do to prevent it are all information yet to come as experts pore over and verify the data.\n",

      "America delivered more AR/VR revenue than China last year, but Chinese growth in the next five years could see it dominate AR/VR long-term — and not by a small margin. With the potential to take more than $1 of every $5 spent on AR/VR globally by 2022, the natural advantages of the Chinese AR/VR market are a golden opportunity (or threat) for domestic and international players. Combine China with other major countries in the region, and Asia could deliver around half of AR/VR global revenue in five years time. Western companies might need to adopt a we try harder approach to compete at the same level. Since 2015 we ve said that ubiquitous AR could dominate focused VR long-term. While the two markets might merge into unified XR (or some other acronym) one day, they could have very different dynamics for the foreseeable future. AR (mobile AR, smart glasses) could approach 3.5 billion installed base and $85 billion to $90 billion revenue by 2022, while VR (console, PC, mobile, standalone) might deliver 50 to 60 million installed base and $10 billion to $15 billion revenue in the same time frame. (Note: Digi-Capital s base case is that even with 900 million installed base for ARKit/ARCore by the end of this year, AR/VR revenue will only start to scale in 2019.) To understand what s happening across the 55 major AR/VR countries and regions, let s start with VR. America might win the battle for VR VR s smaller installed base, lower mobility and exclusive immersion (i.e. limited plurality) focuses it on entertainment use cases and revenue streams. Entertainment (games, location-based entertainment, video) could take two-thirds of VR sector revenue long-term, with hardware taking just over a quarter due to limited unit sales and price competition. The VR market s country dynamics have much in common with the wider video games market. The U.S. has a significant installed base of Sony s VR capable games consoles (banned in China until recently) and high-end VR-capable PCs. It also has highly profitable core gamer economics, which could give it an advantage if premium standalone VR (neither PC nor mobile tethered) hits its stride in a few years. While China has a much larger mobile installed base, mobile/standalone VR s trajectory took a fundamental hit last year, following the launch of mass-market mobile AR. Combined with lower ARPU for mobile/standalone VR, China is at a relative disadvantage to the West on a per user basis. The U.S. could take around one-fifth of global VR revenue by 2022, making it slightly larger than China. But while the U.S. could win the VR battle, it might be a small victory. Combining China with other countries in the region (particularly Japan and South Korea), Asia could deliver just under half of global VR revenue in five years — over twice North America. Europe (led by the U.K., Germany, France) could also deliver, but the European region combined might only be slightly larger than either the U.S. or China individually. China could win the war with AR The dynamics of AR look very different. An installed base in the billions is coming for mobile AR. If and when Apple launches smartphone-tethered smart glasses (we ve been forecasting 2020 for a while now), that market could grow from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions installed base in five years. Because of this distribution potential, a Cambrian explosion of new use cases and business cases is beginning to emerge. E-commerce sales (goods & services, not IAP), hardware sales, ad spend, app store (non-games and games), enterprise and location-based entertainment hold significant promise for AR long-term. So where VR looks like a subset of the games market, AR s long-term dynamics could be more like mobile. That s where China s natural advantages give it the edge over every other country on the planet (including the U.S.). Chinese ARCore could have an installed base approaching ARKit’s scale globally long-term. Add to that ARKit itself in China, plus domestic Chinese mobile AR from Tencent, Alibaba and others, and a clearer picture of Chinese scale emerges. Then from 2020, smartphone-tethered smart glasses could become premium peripherals to Apple and others phones, again leveraging China s inherent mobile strength. This could see China dominate global mobile AR and smart glasses’ installed bases long-term. Then there s China s market dynamics, business models and economics to consider: What does all this mean for AR? E-commerce could be the largest AR business model, where China (particularly Alibaba) might dominate. Smart glasses hardware sales could come next, with premium Chinese iPhone users core to Apple s potential long-term smart glasses dominance (whether they call them iGlasses or not). Tencent is in prime position for the third-largest business model of AR advertising, which explains its battles with Alibaba (although Facebook Camera Effects could generate more revenue internationally). And that s not to mention Chinese iOS and Android AR app store revenues (both non-games and games), enterprise AR and location-based AR entertainment at scale. Combining China s impending AR installed base, business models and economics, and it could see nearly one-quarter of all AR revenues globally by 2022. This is almost half again what the U.S. might produce in a similar time frame. Merging all the country data for a regional view, and Asia could take more than half, Europe less than one-quarter and North America less than one-fifth of global AR revenues. It s a small world after all Installed bases, use cases and economics are great levelers in tech markets, and so it is for AR/VR. While the U.S. might win VR, China could dominate much larger AR. So whoever wins AR also wins AR/VR globally — right now that looks like China by a country mile. This is not to say that the U.S. and other western countries can t do very well from AR/VR long-term (indeed, we forecast that they should). However Asia, China in particular, is critical to the future of the market. Global players need to find a way to compete, or risk being left behind. While Apple could do well as always, for everyone else it s all to play for.\n",

      "Notation Capital, the NY-based pre-seed fund that launched in 2015, has just picked up a fresh $27 million in capital to invest in to super early stage startup sin the NYC area. The fund is called Notation II, and it s still run by Nick Chirls, who led seed investment at betaworks and helped build Alphaworks, and Alex Lines, an architect at betaworks who contributed to products like Digg, Chartbeat, and bit.ly. Alongside the more than tripling in size of the second fund from the first, there s another distinction to be made: Chirls and Lines want to stay away from the term pre-seed and go with first-check investment instead. To this day, we find that founders are still confused on how to navigate the early-stage funding landscape, said Nick Chirls. The early-stage landscape has splintered into millions of different financing, from seed firms, pre-seed firms, angels, scout funds, and accelerators. It s brought more questions than it has answers. The clearest messaging for us is that we want to be your first check. You can call it pre-seed or seed or angel or whatever you want. When Notation Capital first launched, it was based on a few core premises. The first was that the NYC tech ecosystem would continue to grow. The second was that traditional early-stage firms would continue raising larger rounds and writing bigger checks, moving into later stage rounds. The last was that NYC doesn t have the same deep pool of angel investors as SV. As we ve seen from the Series A Squeeze, that premise seems to be pretty accurate. With Notation I, the firm wrote 28 checks, with only two financings going outside of the NYC area. The average check size was about $200K as part of a round from $500K to $1 million total. Notation II aims to fund the same amount of companies, but with checks between $350K and $400K for the same size rounds, which will leave reserves for follow-ons. Notation II also aims to serve other non-SV ecosystems along the Eastern Corridor, investing in talent in Toronto, Boston and D.C. That said, Chirls said he expects between 80 and 90 percent of funding to go to the NYC area.\n",

      "Ahead of Mark Zuckerberg’s Senate testimony today, Facebook has rolled out a number of product updates — including a bounty hunting program of up to $40,000 for user data violations — meant to address (and blunt) the criticism he’s likely to face. The bounties start at $500, according to a report by CNBC, and will be awarded if certain conditions are met. First announced amid a slew of updates Zuckerberg offered up in March as the scandal around abuse of user data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica was first coming to light, the new bounty program is modeled off of Facebook’s attempts to combat hackers with a $1 million bounty. It’s the second product announcement today, following news that Facebook would stop apps from accessing user data if they haven’t been launched within 90 days. To be eligible for the bounty, the offending app must impact more than 10,000 Facebook users and show a clear pattern of abuse and not “collection” (in this case, I’m assuming abuse would qualify as transferring the data to a third party without permission). Facebook also stipulated that it should be a case that the company isn’t already actively investigating. Examples of “out of scope” scenarios include: scraping, malware, social engineering applications, and cases involving other Facebook companies (like Instagram). Facebook goes on to assure that if whistleblowers comply with the company’s policy, then the company won’t sue them (which is very big of Facebook). It also tries to ensure that all of the issues are kept quiet and far away from the meddling of the media which could blow the whole thing up and force company executives to testify in front of Congressional hearings. Here are some other details from the program: You give us time to investigate and act on an issue that you report before making any information about the report public or sharing such information with others. You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) unauthorized access to or destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our or another’s services. You provide us with the Facebook data we request after we request it. You do not violate any other applicable laws or regulations, including (but not limited to) laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorized access to data. Again, do not submit any data to us that you obtained unlawfully. Those are the requirements for folks who submit bounties to Facebook. For its part, Facebook agrees to investigate and validate the reports; determine the amount of the bounty; takes responsibility for publishing reports and updates on the bounty; and indicates that one bounty is paid per abuse (if multiple reports of abuse are submitted, it’s first come, first served for payouts). No word yet on whether Facebook will be paying individual journalists or The Guardian or the The New York Times retroactively. So, do news organizations get back pay from this Data Abuse Bounty? https://t.co/VpnFdlglAh — Shira Ovide (@ShiraOvide) April 10, 2018\n",

      "Perry Coneybeer, who left college at age 19 to work full-time at corporate file digitizing startup Ripcord, is alleging improper behavior by Ripcord CEO Alex Fielding. Coneybeer also alleges she was fired in retaliation for reporting a fellow employee to human resources. In a Medium post published today, Coneybeer alleges Fielding told graphic, sexual stories involving other employees. One story was about an employee who allegedly sent Fielding porn, which Fielding then allegedly watched during the workday. He proudly told us he opened and watched the videos all the way through during the audits, she wrote. He then graphically described and pantomimed a sexual act called gloving. He explained the act several times it seemed that he interpreted the confusion on our faces to mean that we didn t quite understand the mechanics. Fielding also allegedly had a bazooka next to his desk. But it wasn t just Fenkell who behaved improperly, Coneybeer writes. It was throughout the company. What ultimately brought Coneybeer to go to HR was when an employee at a company holiday party allegedly made a joke to her boyfriend about raping her. Coneybeer said she reported this to her boss, who then escalated it to HR. Ripcord fired the person who made the rape joke. But within one month, both Coneybeer and her boss were also let go. Coneybeer told TechCrunch she considered filing a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination and retaliation, but decided going this route may be more effective. Coneybeer feels confident in telling her story because she did not sign the severance agreement upon being fired, she told TechCrunch. That agreement included a non-disclosure clause pertaining to speaking negatively of the company. Ripcord, a company that uses robots to digitize paper records, has raised $85 million in total from Google Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Legend Star, Lux Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, Telstra Ventures, Steve Wozniak and con Ventures. TechCrunch has reached out to Ripcord and is waiting to hear back. Ripcord, in a statement to Business Insider, said its board is investigating Coneybeer s allegations and will take appropriate action, if needed. Ripcord also said it cares deeply about fostering a positive workplace culture. Respect and integrity are absolutely integral to our ability to success. As for Coneybeer, she plan to return to school as a sophomore in September. She s also currently looking for internships in tech, with the hope that the industry can change. It disheartens me to think that this is the way the tech industry is right now, she wrote. I m optimistic, though, that a change can be made. The first step is for people to come forward with their stories.\n",

      "The slings and arrows of outrage keep flying at Facebook. Today a coalition of child health advocates has published an open letter addressing CEO Mark Zuckerberg and calling for the company to shutter Messenger Kids: Aka the Snapchat-ish comms app it launched in the US last December targeted at the under 13s. At the time Facebook described Messenger Kids as an easier and safer way for kids to video chat and message with family and friends when they can t be together in person and said the product had been co-developed with parents, kids and experts . The video chat and messaging app includes a child-friendly selection of augmented reality lenses, stickers and manually curated GIFs for spicing up family messaging. At launch Facebook also emphasized there were no ads or paid content downloads inside the app, and also claimed: Your child s information isn t used for ads. Though that particular message coming from a people-profiling ad giant whose business model entirely depends on encouraging usage of its products in order to harvest user data for ad targeting purposes can only hold so much water. And the company has been accused of trying to use Messenger Kids as, essentially, a gateway drug to familiarize preschoolers with its products to have a better chance of onboarding them into its ad-targeting mainstream product when they become teenagers. A study conducted by UK media watchdog Ofcom last fall has suggested that use of social media by children younger than 13 is on the rise despite social networks typically having an age limit of 13-years-old for signups. (In the EU, the incoming GDPR introduces a 13-years age-limit on kids being able to consent to use social media themselves, though Member States can choose to raise the limit to 16 years.) In practice there s little to stop kids who have access to a mobile device downloading and signing up for apps and services themselves unless their parents are actively policing their device use. (Facebook says it closes the accounts of any underage Facebook users when it s made aware of them.) And concern about the impact of social media pressures on children has been rising. Earlier this month, for example, the UK government s Children s Commissioner for England called for parents to ban their kids from using the Snapchat messaging app citing concerns over addictive features and cyber bullying. With Messenger Kids Facebook may well be spying an opportunity to try to outmanoeuvre its teen-focused rival by winning over parents with a dedicated app that bakes in parental controls. However this strategy of offering a sandboxed environment for kids to message with parentally approved contacts isn t winning over everyone. Writing now, under the banner of The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood , the coalition of around 100 child health advocates and groups describes it as particularly irresponsible of Facebook to have launched an app targeting preschoolers at a time when they say there is mounting concern about how social media use affects adolescents wellbeing . Last week, for example, a study conducted by researchers at San Diego State University found that teens who spent more time on social media, gaming, texting and video-chatting on their phones were not as happy as those who played sports, went outside and interacted with people face to face. Younger children are simply not ready to have social media accounts, the coalition argues. They are not old enough to navigate the complexities of online relationships, which often lead to misunderstandings and conflicts even among more mature users. They also do not have a fully developed understanding of privacy, including what s appropriate to share with others and who has access to their conversations, pictures, and videos. They also argue that Facebook s Messenger Kids app is likely to result in young kids spending more time using digital devices. Already, adolescents report difficulty moderating their own social media use, they write. Messenger Kids will exacerbate this problem, as the anticipation of friends responses will be a powerful incentive for children to check and stay on a phone or tablet. Encouraging kids to move their friendships online will interfere with and displace the face-to-face interactions and play that are crucial for building healthy developmental skills, including the ability to read human emotion, delay gratification, and engage with the physical world. The group goes on to rebut Facebook s claims that Messenger Kids helps brings remote families closer by pointing out that a dedicated Facebook app is not necessary for children to keep in touch with long distance relatives, and citing the plethora of alternative options that can be used for that (such as using a parents Facebook or Skype account or Apple s FaceTime or just making an old fashioned telephone call) which do not require kids to have their own account on any app. [T]he app s overall impact on families and society is likely to be negative, normalizing social media use among young children and creating peer pressure for kids to sign up for their first account, they argue, adding: Raising children in our new digital age is difficult enough. We ask that you do not use Facebook s enormous reach and influence to make it even harder. Please make a strong statement that Facebook is committed to the wellbeing of children and society by pulling the plug on Messenger Kids. Asked for a response to the group s call to close down Messenger Kids, a Facebook spokesperson sent us the following email statement reiterating its messaging around the product at the time it launched: Messenger Kids is a messaging app that helps parents and children to chat in a safer way, with parents always in control of their child s contacts and interactions. Since we launched in December we ve heard from parents around the country that Messenger Kids has helped them stay in touch with their children and has enabled their children to stay in touch with family members near and far. For example, we ve heard stories of parents working night shifts being able read bedtime stories to their children, and mums who travel for work getting daily updates from their kids while they re away. We worked to create Messenger Kids with an advisory committee of parenting and developmental experts, as well as with families themselves and in partnership with the PTA. We continue to be focused on making Messenger Kids be the best experience it can be for families. We have been very clear that there is no advertising in Messenger Kids. Discussing what evidence there is to support concerns over the development impact of digital devices on preschool children, John Oates, a senior lecturer in developmental psychology at the Open University who specializes in early childhood, told us: The difficulty is that we have very high profile anecdotal cases [of social media concern, where the specific risk is tiny vs the total volume of chats being sent] But, clearly the harm is potentially great and the real issue is balancing risks and harm. There is very little large scale evidence around actual developmental impacts on children. And I think that s a problem and it s difficult to know quite how one would research that anyway. In, to isolate cause and effect in this area is really, really difficult. Because children differentially access and use these social media because of their differing profiles let s call them personality profiles. So some children are more likely to be drawn to use social media and then some of those children are more likely to use it in negative ways, and then some of those children are more likely to be then exposed, as a result, to risk. So the cause and effect chain that s involved is very complex. Oates also points out that younger children, in the 6 to 12 years age range which Facebook Messenger Kids targets, are firstly not necessarily aware of the risks and potential harms, and secondly are also not cognitively well able to analyze, rationally, the risks and make risk-free decisions . So I think there is a difficulty around all social media in terms of children getting access to it when they re not aware of the risks. Whether they could be educated better or not is a difficult question because if they re not cognitively able to make rational, risk-based judgements it could be argued that no matter what parents do, and no matter what education does this is still risky for children, he said. The other issue he raises as being a point of discussion and concern for child psychologists is the extent to which extensive use of social media might be a problem by taking children away from other activities that may be more valuable. There is a concern there, but there again it comes back to what differences in children predisposed them to get very involved in Snapchat and other social media, Facebook, etc, he told TechCrunch. And it seems that one of the main motivations for children is a social one, to feel that they are part of a social group that they can identify with. We know that children in this age range are very sensitive to peer approval and peer disapproval. So they re often quite aware of negative messaging on social media even if they haven t experienced it, they ll know about it. Because this is very salient to them. So it s really the nature of their social nexus that they form that s probably the formative element and the messaging within that. It is a real challenge to unpick cause and effect in this area, he added. That s why answering these questions is extremely difficult. But I think what we can do, on the other hand, is we can draw tentative conclusions from what we do know about children s development [such as the strong influence of peers]. Oates also raises the potential of apps that enable children to form social networks digitally (vs only being able to do that face to face) as being a positive change for children seeing the world from a whole variety of perspectives and seeing bits of the world that they wouldn t otherwise see; seeing other children s points of views and so on and so forth . There s a lot of potential there and I wouldn t be just simply negative about this. But recognize that with anything that opens up children s worlds there are risks as well as benefits, he added.\n",

      "Media executives sometimes say that their companies are like a startup but in the case of This Old House, that s actually kind of true, since Time Inc. sold the 40-year-old brand (best known for the home improvement TV show of the same name) to Eric Thorkilsen and TZP Growth Partners less than two years ago. Thorkilsen, who now serves as CEO of This Old House Ventures, has a history with the brand. He said that it s actually gone through multiple periods of reinvention and startup thinking like when Time launched the print magazine in 1995, or when it acquired the show from public TV station WGBH in 2001 (both initiatives that Thorkilsen led). And it s happening again, as it s spun out as an independent media organization, and as it launches it first digital-only property, House One. We can build on that kind of startup attitude and culture in the way that we think about this brand that s about to turn 40, Thorkilsen said. In what ways can we build it and rebuild it and renovate and add to it that will give it still more growth opportunities going forward? House One launched its social media channels a couple of months ago, with the website going live today. The goal is to reach a younger audience of millennials both renters and first-time homeowners who are in need of some advice, as well as more serious DIY craftspeople. To lead the effort, Thorkilsen hired someone else with a real connection to This Old House Jennifer Largesse, who served as a writer and producer for the magazine before joining About.com and eventually launching her own woodworking site Build Basic. While there s plenty of instructional home improvement content already online, Largesse argued that it tends to be gimmicky and superficial, while House One will be distinguished by its depth: No one is offering the instructions that these homeowners are in search of. So not only does House One offer detailed instructions on things like cleaning a dishwasher or building a floating shelf it also includes project files and what Largesse called cornerstone content that helps less experienced readers figure out how to use tools and learn other basic skills. House One is divided into different channels, each hosted by someone who s already built an audience for DIY content. So Largesse is the face of project and tool tutorials, while Aaron Massey (host of the Mr. Fix It channel on YouTube) is the host for home fixes and upgrades and Kirsten Grove of Simply Grove is handling design files. We re a community of makers who already exist in the digital space, Largesse said. And if you re already a fan of the work that these hosts are doing elsewhere, that s not going to stop: All of our content creators will continue with their own brands. That s why we chose them in the first place, because they had this awesome thing already happening. We don t want to replace that, we just want to be a part of it. Featured Image: House One\n",

      "As the US media, tech world and the powers that be in Washington continue to try to figure out how to tackle things like fake news, the level of discourse, and how to keep the business of publishing from falling off a virtual cliff, one of the media properties that has been instrumental in influencing how news is framed online is making a big change. HuffPost in the US today announced that it is sunsetting its contributors platform also known as its unpaid blogger platform. The news was broken by HuffPost (which, like TechCrunch, is part of Oath), which directly tied the move to the changing tides (not Tide Pods, although I personally think there is a connection) in the world of news media and how technology is used to distribute it. Now, there are many places where people can share and exchange ideas, HuffPost editor in chief Lydia Polgreen writes in a post on the site. Perhaps a few too many: One of the biggest challenges we all face, in an era where everyone has a platform, is figuring out whom to listen to. Open platforms that once seemed radically democratizing now threaten, with the tsunami of false information we all face daily, to undermine democracy. When everyone has a megaphone, no one can be heard. Our hope is that by listening carefully through all the noise, we can find the voices that need to be heard and elevate them for all of you. The news was quietly slipped underneath an announcement of two new sections of HuffPost where the blog would now be commissioning (that is, paying) for contributions, Opinions and Personal. You might, in fact, say that she buried the lede, given how big the contributors platform had become. Between the launch of the contributors network in 2005 and today, it had amassed over 100,000 unpaid writers on the US site. The real achievement of the platform was giving a spotlight to a huge number of people who weren t previously afforded one, Polgreen writes. In a time before the ubiquity of social media, the HuffPost platform was a public square where Americans of all walks of life could have a voice on matters both political and personal. Notably, the UK version of HuffPost is not abandoning its unpaid blogger platform although it is scaling it down quite a bit. It s not clear what other outposts of the HuffPost plan to do. (I m going to ask and see if I get a response: to be clear, I didn t have a heads-up about today s news.) The free-content surge on HuffPost definitely had its critics, including some of the bloggers themselves. After The Huffington Post (as it was known at the time) was acquired by AOL in 2011 for $315 million, the company saw a group of them raise the alarm and claim that they were due a cut, given that their content helped contribute to the traffic surge for the blog, which at the time was getting 15.6 million pageviews per day, making it one of the biggest news sites in the world. The founder of TechCrunch, Michael Arrington who had his own issues with the Huffington Post and upper management at Aol used the issue to goad them all when he was still the head honcho here, by sporting a shirt in TC green with the words Unpaid Blogger printed on it, at the Disrupt conference not long after AOL bought TC. Ultimately, the unpaid bloggers didn t get what they wanted, twice seeing the case dismissed. More generally, critics believed that the process of running unpaid posts was optimised for traffic and clicks above all else. A lot of that kind of content gets a terrible wrap even if there are some diamonds among the dirt and today it may not even be serving its original purpose very well. The converse of what Polgreen writes that there are a number of places where you can share ideas is that perhaps contributor networks are starting to lose traffic steam, on top of appearing like enablers of sub-par content, at a time when we re seeing an eroding of credibility of what we read online and need more quality, more than ever before. I ll be interested to see if HuffPost s move signals more of these unpaid blogger platforms (ahem, Forbes) changing tack, and just as significantly whether these sites can find the magic formula to replace it in their revenue streams if and when they do.

      "Rappler, a high-profile new media news organization in the Philippines, is facing closure after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revoked its registration for an alleged breach of the country s constitution. Rappler was started in 2012 by Filipino journalist Maria Ressa and it is a global case study for media in the 21st century with a digital-first platform and focus on independent reporting. The site ranks as the Philippines tenth most popular website, according to Alexa, and it has over 3.5 million Facebook fans. Its articles cover domestic and international news but has expanded into Indonesia. Rappler has also grown to become one of the most critical voices of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte s government. Elected into office in June 2016, Duterte s policies have included a controversial war on drugs that has led to the deaths of over 12,000 Filipinos to date. He is known overseas for calling then-U.S. President Barack Obama a son of a whore and has joked that soldiers are free to rape women among other things. The SEC s issue centers around the ownership of Rappler. The company has taken investment from Omidyar Network, the philanthropic fund from former eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and North America-based media fund North Bridge Media, which counts Quora and Disqus among its portfolio. Philippines law forbids any overseas ownership of media companies, but Rappler claims its investors used a Philippine Depositary Receipt (PDR) to invest. PDRs don t provide voting equity or board membership, making them a vehicle for media investments in the country. National broadcaster ABS-CBN is among others to have used them. The SEC, however, has voided the Omidyar Network s PDR and thus revoked Rappler s Certificate of Incorporation. That essentially amounts to a request to close the business. The SEC has been investigating Rappler s ownership structure since July 2017 when it created a committee to look into the issue. Duterte himself said he would investigate the media firm after he said it was fully owned by Americans. That s led to a belief that there s a political agenda behind this investigation, particularly given past history before the two. The President s comments are just one of a series of flash points between Rappler and the government which have seen the media organization and its staff attacked by supporters of the President and his government, as detailed in a recent Bloomberg story. Rappler confirmed that it will appeal the decision and continue to operate as usual. We intend to not only contest this through all legal processes available to us, but also to fight for our freedom to do journalism and for your right to be heard through an independent platform like Rappler, Rappler wrote in response to news of the SEC s decision. We ve been through a lot together, through good and bad sharing stories, building communities, inspiring hope, uncovering wrongdoing, battling trolls, exposing the fake. We will continue bringing you the news, holding the powerful to account for their actions and decisions, calling attention to government lapses that further disempower the disadvantaged, it added. #ANCRecap: \"I am extremely stubborn. When we fight for what is right, we will stand the line.\" Rappler CEO Maria Ressa says she will not be intimidated with the SEC order closing the online news site. pic.twitter.com/CZvxd22j8T ABS-CBN News Channel (@ANCALERTS) January 15, 2018 The publication was supported by media groups and politicians in the Philippines. SEC s decision revoking Rappler s registration is an authoritarian measure and an attack against press freedom. This is a confirmation that the Duterte government is intolerant of a critical institution, especially from the media sector, Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao said in a statement reported by The Inquirer. The decision, which is tantamount to killing the online news site, sends a chilling effect to media organizations in the country, the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines wrote in a statement. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said it was outraged by the decision. It cited Duterte s comments against Rappler last year which are but one of many threats [he] has made against media critical of him and his governance. Rappler is raising five million PHP (around $100,000) to help with its legal case at this page here. There are three months and 30 days more to run but it has already hit 25 percent of that target.

      "Michael Pollan, the best-selling author of food books including the The Omnivore s Dilemma and Food Rules, summarized his philosophy of eating quite simply. Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. The idea was to spend more on quality, and avoid the sorts of junk food that are deeply unhealthy for our physical bodies. I think it s well past time to borrow that philosophy for our brains. Today, we eat a rich and decadent buffet of brainjunk of useless tweets, of photos of people we don t know, of articles that were written in ten minutes to stoke the content boiler. The dopamine cycle ensures that we keep on craving more content, the exact same dopamine cycle that makes a Happy Meal a happy meal. So let me propose a little framework: Enjoy content. Not too much. Mostly paid . I was thinking about this brainjunk challenge as the world has burned down this week at two of America s most storied publications. On Monday, we learned that Newsweek fired its editor-in-chief and executive editor, along with Celeste Katz, a reporter who had covered the news of the Manhattan DA s office raiding Newsweek headquarters a few weeks ago. Following the raid, the founder and chairman of holding company Newsweek Media Group, along with the company s finance director (who happens to be the chairman s wife), have left the building as well. Meanwhile in Southern California, we have witnessed the complete breakdown of the Los Angeles Times, which has been roiled with conflict since the installation of Lewis D Vorkin as editor last October. Last week, Tronc, the parent company of the Times, fired D Vorkin along with publisher Ross Levinsohn, the former for presumed mismanagement of the newsroom, the latter presumably for alleged sexual harassment at a former employer. This week, sources and leaks indicate that Tronc is attempting to sell the paper to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire who made his money in the biotech space, and who has been attempting to buy the paper from Tronc for more than a year now. Those talks are still on-going. If old soldiers don t die and just fade away, then media companies are pretty much the opposite: they die, and they die in spectacular, political fashion. SpaceX this is not. If it wasn t clear, we are no longer talking about small town newspapers losing their classifieds revenue and going belly up. The internet and its disruption of traditional print business models has now reached the watershed of publications like Newsweek and the Los Angeles Times, household names with large paying subscriber bases who loved their Pulitzer Prizes. It s not enough. And frankly, nothing is enough in a world in which readers crave brainjunk at the expense of all other quality content. People want free content and they want a lot of it, and media companies have been more than happy to oblige. More articles, more videos, all cheaply made and distributed through the purveyors of brainjunk like Facebook and Twitter. Lewis D Vorkin, before joining the Los Angeles Times, was chief product officer at Forbes, where he pioneered the open platform model that has juiced Forbes traffic while tarnishing that publication s brand equity. That s why Tronc hired him he understood brainjunk and just how lucrative it could potentially be. It is the deep irony of our times that readers, often deeply educated, will shell out $30 for a meal in New York or San Francisco while paying thousands in rent, only to avoid paying a few bucks a month for a publication, let alone ten. The monthly price for the New York Times is the price of a single cocktail these days in Manhattan. The bulk of my friends don t pay for subscriptions. The bulk of the internet doesn t pay for subscriptions. People will gladly spend hours a day reading brainjunk, to avoid even the slightest expense that might improve the quality of what they are reading. And so, even storied publications are going to fall by the wayside so we can read about 7 Tips on How To Improve Media. If you want to consume McDonald s, be my guest. If you want to read whatever LinkedIn calls news, go right ahead. But if you actually want to learn, to improve your mind, to improve your awareness and understanding of the world, you have to shell out. Start paying. If you re about to read articles for an hour or two, start thinking about what that time is worth and whether you can spend more to maximize the quality of what you are reading. Enjoy content. Not too much. Mostly paid. And if a publication yes, including TechCrunch doesn t offer paid options, ask for them. Force publishers to take your money and align themselves with your interests over advertisers. Break those dopamine habits, and end brainjunk. Now, go click on a dozen articles so TC can make a dollar, okay? Featured Image: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty Images\n",

      "Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corporation, today issued a statement calling for Facebook and Google to subsidize the news traveling through their platforms. In the statement, Murdoch calls on Facebook to pay a carriage fee, as cable companies do with pay TV, to trusted publishers that are posting their content on the social media platform: I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. The time has come to consider a different route. If Facebook wants to recognize trusted publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies. The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services. This comes fresh on the heels of a change to Facebook s News Feed algorithm, which prioritizes posts from friends and family over those from publishers and content providers. Facebook said that the change was meant to increase well-being among users, offering a more proactive way to build a community and positive sentiment across the network. But Wall Street didn t react well to the change, which Facebook predicted would decrease time spent on the network, which ultimately will decrease the time users spend looking at advertisements. As part of the announcement, Facebook s News Feed chief Adam Mosseri didn t have many concrete suggestions for publishers worried about decreased visibility on the world s biggest social media platform, simply saying publishers should try experimenting and seeing what content gets more comments, more likes, more reshares. This also follows an ongoing situation around news credibility on social networks like Facebook. The spread of fake news across the internet, most noticeably on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, may very well have changed the course of the 2016 election. Whether it was sparked and spread by foreign actors like Russia or domestic political groups, it has forced Facebook to try to remedy the situation over the past year. Facebook s original entry into the world of media, the launch of Instant Articles in 2015, has spurred voracious consumption of news on the platform. Pew says that around two-thirds of U.S. adults get their news from social media sites, with 20 percent saying they do so often. This has disenfranchised many publishers who require a direct connection with readers to maintain credibility. If all articles look the same, and many readers are looking at an entirely different front page on Facebook, establishing the one and only truth of any matter becomes more difficult. And let s not forget that the media industry is in its own, continued transformation as century-old print publications try to move digital. Murdoch, one of the most successful people in news media, doesn t see much progress with new business models such as subscriptions and pay walls, but does see an opportunity in making the pipes pay. An unrealistic proposal However, on closer inspection his suggestion is disingenuous. To publicly issue a carefully scripted statement with questionable insinuations (Facebook is equated to a cable provider) and very few details is more mud-slinging than muckraking. We re not saying Facebook shouldn t be paying somebody something, but this isn t a realistic solution and I don t think Murdoch really believes it is either. Carriage fees are pretty simple. Your cable provider pays a fee per subscriber to networks like ESPN and AMC in order to carry their programming; these fees vary from under a dollar for specialty or less popular networks (AMC, FX) to more than $6 (ESPN, by far the most expensive). The idea is that you as a subscriber are paying for access to these channels, and then paying for the convenience of having them delivered to your TV by the cable company. The $40-50 is really only routed through the cable companies for convenience (yours and theirs). But while that makes sense for a cable provider with millions of subscribers in a single region of the U.S., all paying $50 or more for the privilege of watching live TV, it s a poor match for the likes of Facebook. Facebook s viewers, just off the top of my head: are all over the world in different regions and jurisdictions don t choose what they see (nor does Facebook, arguably) pay nothing are already monetized indirectly by both Facebook and publishers If Facebook pays a carriage fee for the privilege of carrying content from the Hindustan Times, and it shows up as a Facebook Instant Article in an American s news feed because a British PR firm paid for it to be promoted, because it wants to drive subscribers, and it does who exactly owes whom what? Who is paying what, for what? Who determines what is trusted, and what would happen to sources that aren t trusted ? Should Facebook literally pay every site a fee for every one of its billion (or however many) users, for the possibility that someday, some item may show up in any of those users feeds? You can see that this quickly descends into chaos. Murdoch s suggestion is a horse and buggy solution for a company working on self-driving cars. Clearly something else is needed. Facebook is raking in cash and is confident that companies like Murdoch s can t survive without the reach that social media provides. Why would it as an ostensibly objective platform for users to post content attempt what is trusted and then pay them for the title? Supposedly, trusted publishers pay for promotion on the platform and receive value in the form of readers, who view their ads and may eventually buy a subscription. Of course, Facebook undermines this value proposition all the time and publishers are upset at their emasculation and inability to dictate terms, as many have for decades. No one has a solution for the very real problem of modern media monetization, but Murdoch s suggestion is worse than most. Publishers lost the last few rounds by clinging to the past, they re not going to win the next one or even force a draw by doubling down and making empty threats with non-existent leverage. You can read Murdoch s full statement below: Facebook and Google have popularized scurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable. Recognition of a problem is one step on the pathway to cure, but the remedial measures that both companies have so far proposed are inadequate, commercially, socially and journalistically. There has been much discussion about subscription models but I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. We will closely follow the latest shift in Facebook s strategy, and I have no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a sincere person, but there is still a serious lack of transparency that should concern publishers and those wary of political bias at these powerful platforms. The time has come to consider a different route. If Facebook wants to recognize trusted publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies. The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services. Carriage payments would have a minor impact on Facebook s profits but a major impact on the prospects for publishers and journalists. Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n",

      "Seems Disney might not be able to waltz into a 21st Century Fox acquisition, after all. Comcast this morning announced plans to launch its own bid from the movie studio, offering a vague outline for a planned bid. In a statement, Comcast says it s in the advanced stages of preparing an offer for the bits Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney, Comcast writes. The structure and terms of any offer by Comcast, including with respect to both the spin-off of New Fox and the regulatory risk provisions and the related termination fee, would be at least as favorable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer. The announcement of a potential bid follows a $52.4 billion all-stock offer posted by Disney back in December. The acquisition would not include some key Fox assets, including Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network and the Fox Broadcasting Company. CNBC notes that, while Comcast plans to outbid Disney, Fox s owners may ultimately side with the latter, due to an offer for a tax-free spin off of the company. Disney s bid arrived as the company is planning its own streaming services to compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu the latter of which all three companies currently own a partial stake in. Further complicating things here is the fact that Comcast is currently in a bidding war for Sky. The company is close to getting UK government approval on its $31 billion bid to buy the British broadcaster. Its chief competitors? Disney and Fox, naturally.\n",

      "Comcast made good on its plans to make an offer for 21st Century Fox’s film and TV assets today, with a cash bid of $65 billion, or $35 per share. That’s 19 percent more than the $52.4 billion that Disney agreed to pay in December. This follows yesterday’s U.S. court approval of the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, which was widely expected to lead Comcast to make a new bid for Fox and, in the long-term, set the stage for broader consolidation between ISPs and media companies. (This is where I remind you that TechCrunch is owned by Oath, a digital media subsidiary of Verizon.) In a letter to Fox executives (namely Rupert, James and Lachlan Murdoch), Comcast CEO Brian Roberts wrote that after meetings last year, his team was convinced that Comcast would be “the right strategic home” for the Fox assets, and that “we were disappointed when 21CF decided to enter into a transaction with The Walt Disney Company, even though we had offered a meaningfully higher price.” “In light of yesterday s decision in the AT&T/Time Warner case, the limited time prior to your shareholders meeting, and our strong continued interest, we are pleased to present a new, all-cash proposal that fully addresses the Board s stated concerns with our prior proposal,” Roberts said. This could set off a battle between Comcast and Disney . The assets at stake include the Fox film studio (which owns the Avatar franchise, the film rights to the X-Men and Fantastic Four and the original Star Wars), its TV studio, its cable networks and its stake in Hulu. In the letter, Roberts also said a Comcast-Fox acquisition is “as or more likely to receive regulatory approval than the Disney transaction” and that Comcast would reimburse Fox for the $1.5 billion breakup fee with Disney. Update: Fox sent out a statement confirming that it has received the bid. It also said, “21st Century Fox has not yet made a determination, in light of Comcast’s proposal, as to whether it will postpone or adjourn” its July 10 stockholder meeting to discuss the Disney acquisition.\n",

      "The woman who attacked YouTube’s headquarters in San Bruno yesterday may have been acting out of anger over the site’s content policies. “At this point in the investigation it is believed that the suspect was upset with the policies and practices of YouTube . This appears to be the motive for this incident,” said San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini at a press conference Wednesday morning. The police identified Nasim Najafi Aghdam, a San Diego resident, as the shooter; police said they believed she acted alone. Her family reported her missing on March 31. Aghdam was a regular and outspoken YouTube user and had posted dozens of videos on various topics and in several languages. Her personal website and videos make it clear she believed the company deliberately limited the reach of some users, including herself. The suspect also had videos on other sites, including one called “Discrimination Filteration On Youtube” (sic) on vid.me, and the site includes images of her YouTube dashboard showing declines in views over the course of 2016. Specifically Aghdam appears to have been concerned that she was being discriminated against for her veganism, a practice about which she felt very strongly, not on the basis of (for example) her race, gender or other traits. She asserted that one video had been age-restricted by an anti-vegan YouTube employee, and that subsequently the company “began filtering my videos to reduce views & revenue to suppress me!” How this frustration with YouTube’s policies grew into the choice to commit yesterday’s attack is not clear and police did not speculate; the investigation is just starting. The San Bruno police department also did not elaborate on what prior contact Aghdam may have had with the Mountain View police department that same day, in a question from a reporter on the scene. The suspect reportedly accessed the YouTube building through the parking garage, from which she entered the courtyard and began firing indiscriminately. She struck three people before turning the firearm, a licensed and registered 9mm handgun, on herself. “At this point we have no indication that she was selecting individuals to fire on,” Barberini said. “There s absolutely no link or relationship that we ve identified between our suspect and anybody who was at the scene at the time of the incident. We know that she was upset with YouTube; whether that rises to the level of terrorism will hopefully be determined in the coming weeks.” He also praised YouTube and its employees for their quick response: “YouTube s response to this critical incident was also extraordinary. They were extremely prepared to offer services to all of their employees in a swift and timely manner. This would have been much more challenging for us without all of their assistance.” The company had worked with police specifically on policies and measures for dealing with an active shooter. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki addressed the shooting in a tweet yesterday: There are no words to describe how horrible it was to have an active shooter @YouTube today. Our deepest gratitude to law enforcement & first responders for their rapid response. Our hearts go out to all those injured & impacted today. We will come together to heal as a family. — Susan Wojcicki (@SusanWojcicki) April 4, 2018\n",

      "Google Clips gets better at capturing candids of hugs and kisses (which is not creepy, right?) Google Clips’ AI-powered “smart camera” just got even smarter, Google announced today, revealing improved functionality around Clips’ ability to automatically capture specific moments — like hugs and kisses. Or jumps and dance moves. You know, in case you want to document all your special, private moments in a totally non-creepy way. I kid, I kid! Well, not entirely. Let me explain. Look, Google Clips comes across to me as more of a proof-of-concept device that showcases the power of artificial intelligence as applied to the world of photography rather than a breakthrough consumer device. I’m the target market for this camera — a parent and a pet owner (and look how cute she is) — but I don’t at all have a desire for a smart camera designed to capture those tough-to-photograph moments, even though neither my kid nor my pet will sit still for pictures. I’ve tried to articulate this feeling, and I find it’s hard to say why I don’t want this thing, exactly. It’s not because the photos are automatically uploaded to the cloud or made public — they are not. They are saved to the camera’s 16 GB of onboard storage and can be reviewed later with your phone, where you can then choose to keep them, share them or delete them. And it’s not even entirely because of the price point — though, arguably, even with the recent $50 discount it’s quite the expensive toy at $199. Maybe it’s just the camera’s premise. That in order for us to fully enjoy a moment, we have to capture it. And because some moments are so difficult to capture, we spend too much time with phone-in-hand, instead of actually living our lives — like playing with our kids or throwing the ball for the dog, for example. And that the only solution to this problem is more technology. Not just putting the damn phone down. What also irks me is the broader idea behind Clips that all our precious moments have to be photographed or saved as videos. They do not. Some are meant to be ephemeral. Some are meant to be memories. In aggregate, our hearts and minds tally up all these little life moments — a hug, a kiss, a smile — and then turn them into feelings. Bonds. Love. It’s okay to miss capturing every single one. I’m telling you, it’s okay. At the end of the day, there are only a few times I would have even considered using this product — when baby was taking her first steps, and I was worried it would happen while my phone was away. Or maybe some big event, like a birthday party, where I wanted candids but had too much going on to take photos. But even in these moments, I’d rather prop my phone up and turn on a “Google Clips” camera mode, rather than shell out hundreds for a dedicated device. Just saying. You may feel differently. That’s cool. To each their own. Anyway, what I think is most interesting about Clips is the actual technology. That it can view things captured through a camera lens and determine the interesting bits — and that it’s already getting better at this, only months after its release. That we’re teaching AI to understand what’s actually interesting to us humans, with our subjective opinions. That sort of technology has all kinds of practical applications beyond a physical camera that takes spy shots of Fido. The improved functionality is rolling out to Clips with the May update, and will soon be followed by support for family pairing, which will let multiple family members connect the camera to their device to view content. Here’s an intro to Clips, if you missed it the first time. (See below) Note that it’s currently on sale for $199. Yeah, already. Hmmm.\n",

      "The HomePod had a bit of a notable production setback, back in December, but Apple s high-end smart speaker is still on track for an early 2018 release. As it preps for the release of its first Siri-focused device, the company is making some tweaks to its voice assistant. As 9to5Mac first noted, the latest beta version of iOS (11.2.5) sports a new news feature. Hey Siri, give me the news will pop up one of a select few podcasts. It s similar to features currently offered by Amazon and Alexa and Google Assistant. By default (and likely much to the chagrin of certain high-ranking politicians), the system offers up The Washington Post s audio news read. But before you go crying fake news, keep in mind, you also can switch to Fox News, NPR or CNN, so maybe you ll find something in there that adheres more closely to your world view. More selections will no doubt follow soon. Interestingly, the feature is designed specifically for usage when you don t have a display in front of you, like CarPlay and the aforementioned HomePod. This is clearly an attempt to fulfill Siri s stated goal of using the best potential interface method for any scenario. In other words, it s probably just as easy to read a story or hit play on a podcast when you ve got a screen handy. Without a visual cue, Siri has to guess at what sort of news you re looking for. Given the prevalence of smart assistant-driven hardware, it seems safe to assume that more media outlets will be tailoring content to this voice-only input method. Publications are clearly hungry for any potential new news platform.\n",

      "Just a quick bit of news for those with Nest cams around the house: a new, cheaper Nest Aware (read: the cloud recording service that also gives the camera a bit more smarts) plan is on the way. Nest has long offered two plans: a $10/month plan that lets you store the last 10 days of video history, and a $30/month plan that gives you 30 days of video history. This new plan will cost $5 per month and, as you ve probably deduced, will give you five days of video history. This is something folks have been asking for for a while now. Most people don t really need 10 days or more of their video logs; in most cases, the bit of security footage you re most interested in is from the last day or two. It s also nice news for those with multiple Nest cams each one needs its own Nest Aware subscription, so that $10 per month minimum added up fast. In addition to the cloud video recording, a Nest Aware subscription also taps the cloud to teach the Nest Cam a few new tricks: it lets you set Activity Zones (letting you set up alerts when there s motion in certain areas like, say, a door way), create timelapses and it can try to tell whether that thing moving around your living room is a person or just your dog.\n",

      "Amazon is making it easier for parents to manage their child’s device usage from their own phone, tablet, or PC with an update to the Parent Dashboard in Amazon FreeTime. Since its launch in 2012, Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited has been one of the better implementations of combining kid-friendly content with customizable profiles and parental controls. Today, parents can monitor and manage kids’ screen time, time limits, daily educational goals, device activity, and more while allowing children to access family-friendly content like books, videos, apps and games. Last year, Amazon introduced a Parent Dashboard as another means of helping parents monitor screen time as well as have conversations with kids about what they’re doing on their devices. For example, if the child was reading a particular book, the dashboard might prompt parents with questions they could ask about the books’ content. The dashboard also provided a summary of the child’s daily device use, including things like what books were read, videos watched, apps or games played, and websites visited, and for how long. According to a research study Amazon commissioned with Kelton Global Research, the company found that 97 percent of parents monitor or manage their kids use of tablets and smartphones, but 75 percent don t want to hover over kids when they re using their devices. On Thursday, Amazon addressed this problem by allowing parents to remotely configure the parental control settings from the online Parent Dashboard in order to manage the child’s device from afar from a phone, tablet or computer. The controls are the same as those available through the child’s device itself. Parents can set a device bedtime, daily goals and time limits, adjust their smart filter, and enable the web browser remotely. They can also remotely add new books, videos, apps and games to their child’s FreeTime profile, and lock or unlock the device for a set period of time. The addition comes following last year’s launch of FreeTime on Android, and Google’s own entry into the parental control software space with the public launch of Family Link last fall. Apple also this year made vague promises about improving its existing parental controls in the future, in response to pressure from two Apple shareholder groups, Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System. With the increased activity in the parental control market, Amazon’s FreeTime may lose some of its competitive advantages. Amazon also needed to catch up to the remote control capabilities provided with Google’s Family Link. There are those who argue that parental controls that do things like limit kids’ activity on apps and games or turn off access to the internet are enablers of lazy parenting, where devices instead of people are setting the rules. But few parents use parental controls in that fashion. Rather, they establish house rules then use software to remind children the rules exist and to enforce them. The updated FreeTime Parent Dashboard is available via a mobile-optimized website at parents.amazon.com.\n",

      "Technology companies like Facebook and Google are scrambling to catch up to the fact that kids have joined a web originally built for adults, and are using it the way adults do by liking and commenting, sharing, clicking through on personalized recommendations and viewing ads. But the technology underpinning apps and sites built for kids can t operate the same way it does for the grown-ups. That s where the company SuperAwesome comes in. SuperAwesome, just less than five years old, has been tapping into the growing need for kid-friendly technology, including kid-safe advertising, social engagement tools, authentication and parental controls. Its clients include some of the biggest names in the children s market, including Activision, Hasbro, Mattel, Cartoon Network, Spin Master, Nintendo, Bandai, WB, Shopkins maker Moose Toys and hundreds of others many of which it can t name for legal reasons. Now, the company is turning a profit. SuperAwesome says it hit profitability for the first time in Q4 2017, and has reached a booked revenue run-rate of $28 million, after seeing 70 percent growth year-over-year. This year, it expects to grow 100 percent, with a revenue run rate of $50 million. Sources close to the company put its valuation at north of $100 million, as a result. The company says the shift to digital is driving its growth, as TV viewing is dropping at 10 to 20 percent per year, while kids digital budgets are growing at 25 percent year over year. At the same time, the kids brands and content owners are realizing that safety and privacy have to be a part of their web and mobile experiences. SuperAwesome has flown under the radar a bit, and isn t what you d call a household name. That s because its technology isn t generally consumer-facing it s what s powering the apps and websites that today s kids are using, whether that s a game like Mattel s Barbie Fashion Closet or Monster High, Hasbro s My Little Pony Friendship Club or a website from kids author Roald Dahl, to name a few. Key to all these experiences is a technology platform that allows developers to build kid-safe apps and sites. That includes products like AwesomeAds, which ensures ads in the kids space aren t tracking personal data and the ads are kid-appropriate; PopJam, a kid-safe social engagement platform that lets developers build experiences where kids can like, comment, share and remix online content; and Kids Web Services, tools that simplify building apps that require parental consent and oversight. These sorts of tools are increasingly becoming critical to a web that s waking up to the fact that the largest tech companies didn t consider how many kids would be using their products. YouTube, for example, has been scrambling in recent months to combat the threats to kids on its video-sharing site, like inappropriate content targeted toward children, exploitive videos, haywire algorithms, dangerous memes, hate speech and more. Meanwhile, kids are lying about their ages sometimes with parental permission to join social platforms originally built for the 13-and-up crowd, like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Musical.ly. It s very easy to come out and beat up Facebook and Google for some of this stuff, but the reality is that there s no ecosystem there for developers who are creating content or building services specifically for kids. That s why we started SuperAwesome, says SuperAwesome s CEO Dylan Collins. Before SuperAwesome, Collins founded gaming platform Jolt, acquired by GameStop, and game technology provider DemonWare, acquired by Activision. Other SuperAwesome execs have similar successful track records in terms of company-building. Managing director Max Bleyleben was COO at digital marketing agency Beamly, acquired by Coty, and a partner in European VC fund Kennet Partner. COO Kate O Loughlin was previously SVP Media in adtech company Tapad, acquired by Telenor. Chief Strategy Officer Paul Nunn was previously the managing director at kids app maker Outfit7, acquired by China s United Luck Group. Today, the company s 120-person staff also includes a full-time moderation team to review content before it goes public. A need to do more hands-on review, instead of leaving everything up to an algorithm, is something the larger companies have just woken up to, as well. For example, YouTube said it was expanding its moderation team to north of 10,000 people in the wake of the site s numerous controversies. SuperAwesome is much smaller than that, but it has understood the need to double-check kids content with a more hands-on approach for some time. The content created on [SuperAwesome s] platform goes through two layers of moderation. It goes through our machine learning moderation. Then it goes through our 24/7 team of human moderators as well, explains Collins. With the kids audience, it doesn t work to completely automate all this you have to have human involvement. There are now tens of millions of pieces of content flowing through SuperAwesome s platform every couple of weeks, to give you an idea of scale. This online social space is something that kids brands want to enter, but safely and in compliance with U.S. and international laws around child protection, like COPPA and Europe s GDPR-K. Though SuperAwesome s focus a couple of years ago was more about helping advertisers and marketers, today, two-thirds of SuperAwesome ads clients have since adopted its social engagement tools from PopJam. (A demonstration of this technology is also live in SuperAwesome s own kids app by the same name.) Now, SuperAwesome is leveraging its experience in the kids space to help YouTubers come into compliance with Google s stricter rules, too, so they can ensure brands they re kid-safe. SuperAwesome recently rolled out a content certification standard for under-13 YouTube influencers and those over 13 who target a very young audience with their videos. This is something SuperAwesome s brand customers requested, because they re spending their ad dollars on YouTube and sometimes finding their messages matched up with inappropriate content. The problem of toxic content on Facebook and Google could have a massive impact on the ad industry if it continues to go unchecked. For example, one of the world s largest advertisers Unilever this month threatened to pull ads from Facebook and Google if they don t address the problems with propaganda, hate speech and disturbing content aimed at children. SuperAwesome s new, voluntary certification for YouTubers takes into account the content the channel produces, their behavior on the screen, their recording practices, and much more. YouTube is not an under-13 platform, so their hands are kind of tied in terms of something like this, says Collins. The company announced the certification earlier this month, and already has 35 YouTubers on board, representing 35 million subscribers and 8 to 9 billion monthly impressions. There s real momentum that s happening with this, he adds. SuperAwesome believes it s now poised to for rapid growth as more brands and businesses begin to address the needs of keeping kids safe online. Kidtech, as a category, has really just been invented in the past three or four years. No one thought they d have to build specific technology for kids this is problem that we re starting to solve, Collins says. SuperAwesome has raised $28 million to date according to Crunchbase, including a $21 million Series B from Mayfair Equity Partners in mid-2017, which included Hoxton Ventures and Inspire Ventures. The company has no immediate plans to fundraise again. Featured Image: Hero Images/Getty Images\n",

      "Warby Parker has been around for seven years, but today the company is finally unveiling a new product category. In a 12-week pilot program, Warby Parker is now offering kids frames to folks in the NYC area. The company is pulling from some of its most popular frames, shrinking them down to fit kids 8 years and up (Jr.) and kids ages 4-7 (Jr. Jr.). But why not go big with the launch of kids frames? When we look back over the last seven years at our growth and success, we think is due to focus, said Warby Parker cofounder and CEO Neil Blumenthal. Ultimately, strategy is what you say no to. We received that advice early on, and we believe in scaling with integrity. What that means is moving quickly but in a way that s deliberate. Whenever we do something, we want to ensure we do it well. That said, this program doesn t offer all the same convenience that Warby Parker is known for. Parents will have to bring their kids into one of the NYC locations for try-ons, and purchased frames will then be available for delivery nationwide or in-store pickup. Blumenthal explained that Warby Parker didn t offer online try-on to ensure that the experience was handled delicately for kids and their parents. Serving kids is a little bit different than serving adults, and we want to make sure that were being as thoughtful as possible, said Blumenthal. Since we re often dealing with both children and parents, and it might be their first pair of glasses, we want to be extra judicious to ensure it s a great experience for the child. He added that doing the transactions in-store is the best way for Warby to learn about this new market. Historically, Warby Parker made a name for itself letting users choose five pairs to try on at home and return before choosing their preferred frames. Each kids pair will cost $95, just like the adult frames, and they ll be available in acetate. Warby Parker has a history of using the business for social good, offering a pair of glasses to underserved communities for each pair sold. The same is true for the kids pilot program, with each pair purchased going towards the Pupils Project program. The Pupils Project program provides free vision screenings, eye exams, and glasses to children at NYC s Community schools. Warby Parker isn t the first startup to dive into kids glasses frames. Pair Eyewear, which launched in October of last year, aims to be the Warby Parker of kids glasses. The startup gives kids the ability to try on frames at home, via cardboard replicas, and purchase customizable frames at a relatively affordable price point. Over the next three months, Warby Parker will eventually decide how to handle the kids business. Until then, only NYC parents will have the opportunity to pick up some WP specs for their kids.\n",

      "Sarah Lacy, founder of media site Pando, has unveiled her newest company, Chairman Mom. The subscription-based startup aims to provide resources to working mothers, and ultimately set them up to succeed in all areas of their lives. “One of the things that’s actually pretty distinct for us is we focus really on the woman, not the children,” Lacy told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of sites where you can get a lot of answers of what’s a great pre-school or where’s a restaurant that is kid-friendly. and a lot of things are always very kid-centric. We’re really woman centric.” At launch, Chairman Mom is focused on one key functionality: a question and answer platform. Every day, Chairman Mom’s team of three curates two questions — one about life and one about work — from the community to feature on the site for answers and discussion. These questions can range from “How much do you get paid?” to “What’s the best way to handle harassment at work?” to “What should I do if I think my spouse is cheating on me?” “The goal of each thread is to get that mom the best answer,” Lacy said. “It’s really not to have an open discussion board of everyone’s views on that topic.” What makes Chairman Mom different from the likes of other social media sites is its emphasis on using real names while also offering anonymity. Real names are required to sign up but community members can ask and respond to questions anonymously. There is also no up-voting or direct messaging. “We don’t have things that have created tribalism and fights on other mom networks,” Lacy said. The goal with Chairman Mom is to rebrand what working mothers and what working motherhood represents, Lacy said. Before Lacy first became a mother, she heard horror stories about what to expect, she said. Some people, for example, told her to expect to feel like a failure at home and at work. But that’s not what it was like for her, Lacy said. I was shocked at the disconnect between that and what happened when I actually had kids,” Lacy said. What happened when I had kids was I became better at everything. I became more ambitious, I wrote more quickly, I was so much better as a manager. I was so much more productive. You really have this amazing ability to prioritize what s important.” Lacy went with the name Chairman Mom to “telegraph in charge and maternal,” she said. It was important to her, she said, for the name not to conjure up any connotations of shame around pregnancy and motherhood. “It s even a step beyond ‘I m not ashamed,’ but like ‘No, this is our source of power,'” she said. “Something that just sounds so declaratively in charge but also maternal. And it s still called the chairman of the board. And it s this idea of we re overthrowing a patriarchy. This is a man s world that we re overthrowing and we don t have any illusion about that fact.” Chairman Mom costs $5 per month for access to its community of honest answers to questions about working motherhood. By having people pay to access the platform, one hope is that trolls won’t pay actual money to troll, Lacy said. The platform is also free of advertisers and intends to remain that way, Lacy said. Chairman Mom is not the only startup targeting mothers. There’s Peanut, which is a Tinder-like experience for finding other moms to hang out. There’s also Winnie, which helps parents find kid-friendly places and access other resources that may be helpful to parents. Lacy said she recognizes Chairman Mom has competitors, but also recognizes that “it’s such a massive market no one’s building for,” she said. It’s so massive, Lacy said, that she envisions seeing “a handful of billion-dollar consumer internet companies that are geared toward women. Chairman Mom has been in private beta for the last month or so, with “several hundred” people using it. Chairman Mom has raised a $1.4 million seed round led by Ann Miura-Ko of Floodgate Ventures and Tim Connors from PivotNorth Capital, with participation from Greylock Discovery and Precursor Ventures.\n",

      "For the singer-songwriter Starshell, a one-time protege of Mary J. Blige, success comes in many guises and the latest is startup entrepreneur. Her song Birthday Girl , resonated so strongly with fans, says the singer born LaNeah Menzies, that it became something of an anthem. And Menzies has turned that anthem into a business. Her site, Birthday Girl World, saw 208,740 monthly visitors in January, according to the traffic monitoring service SimilarWeb and has had over 250 million impressions since its launch three years ago, the singer said. Now Birthday Girl World has raised $1 million in financing from Value Investment Group, an investment firm founded by Rashaun Williams (an ex-manager for Nasir Jones Queensbridge Venture Partners fund) and Steel Partners to expand. For Menzies, the site isn t just about selling birthday swag, but part of a larger mission that revolves around celebrating women and promoting mental health and wellness. For me, I happened to lose my sister to teenage suicide, Menzies tells me. I decided to build a platform about suicide and mental health and I created a song to back into the idea of loving yourself. I created the song so i could back into the conversation. The song was popular enough to be a minor hit, but Menzies wanted to take her message to a broader platform. I feel like technology was the one way I could generate the most social impact, she says. Music was great, but it was just a song. The site began as a Kickstarter campaign to sell Birthday Girl merchandise, Menzies says as a form of celebration, and has now become a broader platform. The content side is our strongest side. Part of the content we offer are purposeful practices helping you find your purpose; helping you live your best life, says Menzies. On top of that we donate a portion of our proceeds to suicide prevention and mental health. Menzies is also working on a partnership with the Jed Foundation to expand the reach of her message. It s an easier way to talk about mental health because it s about celebrating you, celebrating your life and how to self-care, says Menzies. I was aiming from a world where every woman loves and celebrates themselves. The capital Menzies raised has been used to bring on new staff and build out additional content to supplement the commercial arm of her Birthday Girl empire. Key hires include Stanley Bastien, a former Goldman Sachs employee who has joined as chief operating officer; Jacob Perler, who has joined as the company s chief strategy officer; and Thaddeus Lawrence as the brand officer and content manager. I started with a t-shirt and they wanted more, says Menzies of the Birthday Girl consumers. They wanted content, i gave them that and they wanted more so we gave them a community.\n",

      "More details are out this morning about Apple’s plans for Texture, the digital newsstand business it acquired last month. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is planning to launch its own premium news subscription service in an upgraded version of the Apple News app, arriving sometime in the next year. The service will split revenues between Apple and magazine publishers, but details regarding that split were not available. Today, however, Apple takes a 15 percent cut on subscriptions sold in the App Store. Bloomberg also noted that around twenty Texture employees were cut post acquisition, while the remaining staff and technology is being integrated with the Apple News team. In the past, Apple offered magazines and newspaper subscriptions through its former Newsstand app, and through Apple News, which replaced it. However, these are currently sold individually. Texture, meanwhile, operated more like a “Netflix for magazine publishing,” where readers were able to access around 200 magazines for a monthly fee of $9.99. For $14.99 per month, the subscription would include some weekly magazine titles, as well. Before Apple, Texture was owned by Cond Nast, Hearst, Meredith, Rogers Media and KKR. Assuming Bloomberg is correct in reporting that Texture will lead to a similar subscription-based model for magazines in Apple News, it raises some concerns. Apple notoriously likes to control news about itself, as part of maintaining its public image. This heavy-handed strategy means that Apple won’t respond to some day-to-day press inquiries, unless it’s to set the record straight on unflattering reports. It also likes to pass counterpoints along to favored reporters, at times, in order to quietly get its viewpoints some ink, without its name attached to the reporting. Years ago, it sent police to break down a reporter’s door to regain access to a lost iPhone prototype, that the news org had come to acquire. While not all magazine publishers are focused on “news,” those who do cover tech and Apple specifically, could become uncomfortable with also relying on Apple for subscription revenues. Would any negative reporting affect their standing with the company? Would Apple kick them out of the subscription program, if news became unfavorable? For a company that so tightly protects its reputation, it’s not an outlandish concern. In addition, publishers have already learned the downfalls associated with relying on a platform’s reach and distribution to help keep them afloat, by working with Facebook. The gave up control, only to find their content downgraded in a Facebook algorithm change. That specific scenario doesn’t translate to Apple’s News platform, of course. But publishers may find themselves unable to resist Apple’s call to participate, given its potential to pull in millions of subscribers.\n",

      "Julia is Sesame Street’s first autistic character and her mission is to make neuroatypical kids feel more comfortable and understand that there are kids out there just like them. She’s a sweet little muppet and now she’s getting her own Kickstarter campaign. The campaign is raising $75,000 to produce content and a free book featuring Julia and her friends. They’ve just hit $10,000 in funding and it’s growing fast. $100 gets you a plush Julia doll and if they reach $150,000 they will print a paper copy of the new Julia book. The project aims to help reduce bullying of autistic children and the Sesame Street team will work with experts to create content and a book around Julia’s adventures. From the team: Julia s television debut was greeted with hundreds of media stories and millions of social media impressions, but the biggest marker of our success was the overwhelming response from the autism community and beyond. Parents say their autistic children have more playdates because of Julia. Teachers report that their students are more inclusive in their play. One mother told us that she used the first Julia storybook to explain to her daughter that she, too, has autism. Her daughter responded, So I m amazing too, right? This is Sesame Street’s first Kickstarter and it’s really wonderful. This sort of community call-to-action is just what crowdfunding was born to do and it’s great to see the cash going to such a nice cause.\n",
